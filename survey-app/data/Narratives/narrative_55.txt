Narrative:
I arrived on the scene regarding a disturbance involving loud music coming from parked vehicles. I made contact with a male subject who initially claimed the owner of the vehicle was "on his way" and repeatedly stated, "That's not my car." I informed the subject that we were taking control of the scene due to the volume of the music. When I asked if the music was too loud, the subject argued that he did not have music and that the vehicle was turned off, stating it was "not very loud" and "not regular." Despite his initial denial of ownership, when questioned about a specific key, the subject confirmed the key was for the vehicle and eventually admitted, "It's me," acknowledging responsibility.

I explained to the subject that due to the recurring problems at this location every morning, the "bosses" had decided that all vehicles present were to be removed. I advised him that everyone involved faces potential arrest for coming to this location. The subject requested a chance regarding a blue car, stating he would take responsibility for "any other touch that happens here." I reiterated that it was not my decision but that of the supervisors, and that all cars were "going to go with the guagua."

I instructed the subject that he needed to report to the station to receive a ticket and subsequently go to Station B2 at 2400 Washington Street in Roxbury to retrieve his vehicle. I advised him that he might need to pay for the vehicle's storage for the night. The subject presented his license for identification. During the incident, I observed the subject remove the keys from a Chevy located directly in front of us. I conferred with Officer McDougal and another officer, confirming that all cars and speakers were being seized, and instructed the assisting officer to take photos to ensure accurate booking.
