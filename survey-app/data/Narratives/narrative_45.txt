Narrative:
I approached an individual, [INSERT: Name of Suspect], and engaged in a brief conversation, asking, "What's up, guys?" and "How you been?" I asked the subject if the vehicle present was his, and he confirmed, "This is my car, bro." I instructed the subject to step back. A physical interaction ensued during which I told the subject, "You got it," and repeatedly issued commands to "cut it off" and "don't stop." I observed resistance from the subject and ordered him, "Don't be goofy" and "Don't resist."

Following the initial detention, I directed the subject to walk over to a designated location. I asked him, "You got nothing else on you, right?" and he responded, "No." I then commanded the subject to show me a license to carry a firearm. The subject replied, "I have a driver's license." I asked him what his driver's license said.

I subsequently communicated with Sgt. Jones and announced via radio that we had a firearm recovered at 618 Shawman. I confirmed that the subject was in custody. During the interaction, it was noted that the subject had just turned 18 years old.
