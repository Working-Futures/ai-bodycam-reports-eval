Narrative:
On Monday, October 3rd, 2022, around 10:04 a.m., officers from Boston's B-2 District were on patrol following a shots fired call in the area of Blue Hill Avenue. We observed a vehicle driving at a high rate of speed and conducted a traffic stop in the area of 69 Glenway Street. The vehicle was occupied by a female passenger and a male driver, identified as Tremaine Butler, 32, of Dorchester. During the initial interaction, Mr. Butler denied driving fast or passing the area of the shots fired call. We discussed reports of a white Lexus involved in the incident, though the stopped vehicle was identified as a BMW.

During the investigation, I spoke with the female passenger who stated she lived at 51 Fenway Street and admitted to drinking that morning. I asked if she had identification, and although she initially said no, an ID was recovered. I advised the individual of their Miranda rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to counsel, and they confirmed they understood. When asked if they had a license to carry a firearm, the response was negative. Mr. Butler subsequently admitted to the presence of a weapon, stating, "I just put it in her bag when I see the police." The female passenger claimed she did not know anything about the item.

Upon searching Mr. Butler, officers recovered a 9mm Smith & Wesson handgun loaded with 15 rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber. A check through Criminal Justice Information Services determined that Mr. Butler had outstanding warrants out of Maryland for attempted first-degree murder, attempted second-degree murder, first-degree assault, use of a firearm during a felony, second-degree assault, reckless endangerment, and handgun possession charges. A request was made for a ballistics canine to respond to the scene.

Mr. Butler was placed under arrest based on the warrants and the recovered evidence. He was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of a large capacity feeding device, unlawful possession of ammunition, reckless operation of a motor vehicle, and being a fugitive from justice. The vehicle keys were left with the landlord at the scene as requested by the passenger.
