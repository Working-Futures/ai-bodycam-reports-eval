Narrative: I initiated contact with a male subject, instructing him to "Stay right there." I asked the subject if he had any weapons or "anything crazy" on his person and inquired if he had been involved in an argument; the subject responded, "Nope." I explained to the subject that a caller had reported someone in his group possessed a gun and that we had a description matching his group. I attempted to reach other units, identifying as unit 269. I then communicated with "Charlie, K-1," requesting a PSA detection and stating, "I got a fire in there," followed by the command, "Charlie, detect."

I asked the subject if he had anything else on him and instructed him to sit tight. I then asked, "Where's the weed at?" The subject admitted it was in his bag. I proceeded to ask the subject for his age, to which he replied, "25." I then stated, "I demand to see your license to carry a firearm." The subject responded, "I don't have one." I verbally confirmed with the subject that he did not possess a license.

I contacted Bravo 102 to report our location near 112, uphill, apartment 110. I asked the subject where he was coming from, and he stated he just came from "the store." I asked the subject for his name [INSERT: Subject's Name] and his birthday, which he identified as January 20th. The subject asked, "Can I put my pants on?" and I replied, "Yep." I then coordinated regarding a vehicle equipped with a "cage," specifically inquiring about unit 1524 for transport.
