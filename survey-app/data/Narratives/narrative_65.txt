Narrative:
I made contact with two individuals, a male identified as Taylor (also providing the first name Samil) and a female identified as Zelda, regarding an investigation involving individuals running into cars. Taylor denied the allegations, stating they were a homeless couple walking from Hyde Park to Blue Hill to find a place to sleep. He informed me that he had recently bailed out of custody and stated he had his release papers. I asked for his identification details; he spelled his first name as S-A-M-I-L [INSERT: Last Name] and indicated his age was 35. When asked for an address, he provided the number 580 [INSERT: Street Name/Unit Number].

I conducted a check on both individuals. I confirmed a positive WMS hit for the female subject for a felony default warrant, which included a charge for indecent exposure. I also confirmed that Samil had an active warrant for Breaking and Entering Nighttime and Larceny Under, dating from April 22nd. I informed Samil of the active warrant, noting that it was relatively new, despite his previous claims that he had cleared his status.

I asked Samil if he possessed any weapons or stolen items. He denied having stolen property but admitted, "I'm on knife," and indicated its location on his person. I asked if I could check their bags to see if there was anything stolen, and Samil provided consent, stating, "Yes, brother." During the interaction, Samil pointed out a pipe he referred to as a "stamp" in his bag. I advised Samil regarding the investigation into the car break-ins, stating that if he was going to break into cars, he should not drop needles inside them.

I advised both parties that they had to come with us due to the warrants. Both individuals complied with the arrest without resistance. I allowed them to finish their cigarettes and exchange a kiss before taking them into custody.
