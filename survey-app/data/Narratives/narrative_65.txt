Narrative:
At about 1:30 a.m. on Friday, April 26, 2024, officers assigned to District B3, Mattapan, arrested Samil Mejia and Nicolette Park after they were allegedly caught on a home security surveillance system breaking into a vehicle. Officers observed the suspects walking on Morton Street towards Harvard Street and stopped them. Upon further investigation, we determined that both suspects had active warrants for their arrests.

During the stop, I spoke with the male suspect, identified as Samil Mejia. Mejia initially asked, "What's up my boss?" and stated they were homeless and walking from Hyde Park to Blue Hill to sleep. When I asked if Officer Ford had explained that we were investigating individuals breaking into cars, Mejia acknowledged this but denied the accusation, stating, "We were not." The female suspect initially identified herself as "Taylor," though she was later identified as Nicolette Park. Mejia claimed he had bailed out of police custody approximately four days prior on a Friday.

I conducted a check which confirmed positive WMS hits for both individuals. Mejia had an active felony default warrant for indecent exposure and larceny under $1,200 issued on April 22nd. Park was found to have an active warrant for larceny over $250. When asked if he had any weapons or dangerous items, Mejia admitted, "I'm on knife, that's it," and indicated it was on his person. I also observed Park in possession of a "pipe." I questioned them regarding the property in their possession; both suspects claimed the items, including clothes and shoes, belonged to them, with Park stating she was going to drop items off at a friend's house. I advised Mejia regarding the needles found inside the victim's vehicle during the break-in.

Mejia was placed under arrest and charged with breaking and entering a motor vehicle in the nighttime, receiving stolen property under $250, and trespassing, in addition to the warrant. Park was placed under arrest and charged with breaking and entering a motor vehicle in the nighttime, receiving stolen property, possession of burglarious tools, and trespassing, along with her warrant. Mejia complied with the arrest, extinguishing his cigarette and stating, "Okay, okay. Come with us."
