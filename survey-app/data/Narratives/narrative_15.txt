Narrative:
I reported my location as West Newark and New Orleans and advised dispatch that one individual was in custody. I ordered the suspect, "Don't fucking move." I further advised that a firearm had been recovered. I observed other individuals in the vicinity and repeatedly commanded them to "back up" to secure the scene. I communicated with unit 421, stating, "I'm with him," and "I got it."

I questioned the suspect repeatedly regarding the recovered weapon, asking, "You got a license to carry?" I commanded the suspect to look at me. The suspect eventually responded, "Yes." I then asked the suspect if he had an LTC. During this exchange, the suspect asked if he could get his phone, and I denied this request. The suspect made statements regarding "crafting" and exclaimed, "No, no, my God." I ordered the suspect to "sit up." The suspect inquired why I had removed his hat, and I explained it was so I could see his eyes.

I advised the suspect that I was going to read him a Miranda right before asking any questions and asked, "Do you understand that?" [INSERT: suspect's response to Miranda warning, if any]. The suspect asked to get up, and I told him to hold on. He inquired about a "daughter" and asked for his hat back; I informed him we would bring it to him as we moved him to another location. I stated that I needed to take a look in the bag. The suspect became agitated and asked, "Why the fuck you fucking cuff my bag with me, bro?" I replied, "We should've cuffed you," and then proceeded to get the suspect up.
