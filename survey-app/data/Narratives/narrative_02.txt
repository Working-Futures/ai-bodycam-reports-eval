Narrative:
I was on scene at [INSERT: location of incident] assisting with a male subject. I issued commands for the subject to "stop" and "turn around" multiple times. During the restraint, another officer announced, "I got the gun," indicating a firearm had been recovered from the subject. The firearm was passed to another officer who stated, "Give it to me, I'm going to call it." I clarified to the subject, "I ain't choking him ever," while securing him.

Following the recovery of the weapon, I repeatedly asked the subject, "Do you have LTC [License to Carry], yes or no?" The subject's response was not audible in the recording. An officer then advised the subject, "You're Miranda, you have the right to remain silent," and explained that if he could not afford an attorney, one would be provided. The officer noted, "When we get back to booking, I'll read it to you." The subject asked, "Can you help me up, bro, please?" and complied with orders to "get up" and move to the cruiser.

Officers collected evidence on the scene, with instructions given to "bring your phone to the cruiser" and "put the fanny pack." Later, an officer stated, "He has no MTC," regarding the subject's licensing status. I communicated with "Bravo Base" as unit "Bravo 983" via radio and discussed holding off on immediate processing in case the situation was "related to the C-11 incident." The subject was transported from the scene; the specific probable cause for the initial interaction prior to the discovery of the firearm is not stated in the audio.
