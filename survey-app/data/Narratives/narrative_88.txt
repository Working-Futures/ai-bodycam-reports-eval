Narrative:
I, TechMunition Officer Hines, approached the subject vehicle and made contact with the driver, identified as Jose. I asked Jose where he was coming from, to which he provided vague answers. I informed Jose that he was being detained pursuant to a drug investigation involving an observed transaction. Upon asking if he had any weapons, Jose admitted, "I got a knife on me," indicating it was "underneath." I instructed him not to reach for it and secured the scene. I then advised Jose of his Miranda rights, specifically that he had the right to remain silent, that anything he said could be used against him, and that he had the right to an attorney. Jose indicated he understood but chose to speak, denying involvement in any drug transaction and stating he had been visiting a friend named Adam.

A female passenger interjected, disputing the reason for the stop and claiming the vehicle’s insurance was active, although I informed her that the system showed the registration/insurance as revoked. Another officer asked Jose if he consented to a search of the vehicle, and Jose replied, "No." The officer informed Jose that the vehicle would be checked because his account of events did not match the information obtained from the other party involved in the alleged transaction. While protesting the search of her purse and the glove box, the female passenger stated, "You will find some weed in the middle console and a ball." Jose objected to the search, stating we needed legal consent.

Officers located a firearm in the glove box of the vehicle. Jose was placed in handcuffs; he asked why he was being arrested and stated he was not resisting. I demanded Jose's license to carry a firearm, and he admitted he did not have one. When asked why the firearm was in the glove box, Jose stated it belonged to his nephew who lives in Vermont and had visited a few months prior. Jose admitted he had been driving around with the firearm in the car for a couple of months. I again advised the subject of his Miranda warnings, explaining his right to remain silent and right to counsel before asking further questions. He confirmed he understood and continued to speak, reiterating that the firearm belonged to his nephew. Officers prepared to transport the subject.
