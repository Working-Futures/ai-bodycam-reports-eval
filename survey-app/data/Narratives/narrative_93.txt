Narrative:
I observed a vehicle occupied by a single individual, later identified as Mr. Serrano, commit a traffic violation by running a stoplight situated before the bridge. Upon stopping the vehicle, officers determined that Serrano had been operating under a suspended license. Consequently, Serrano was removed from the vehicle, despite his hesitation to do so. During the interaction, Serrano stated that the vehicle was not his, though he acknowledged it was registered to him and another individual. He expressed concern regarding the vehicle's contents and mentioned a previous arrest for possession, repeatedly denying knowledge of any items currently inside the vehicle. Serrano requested to sit in the patrol car due to the cold temperature, but was informed the vehicle lacked a cage; he was subsequently permitted to sit on the trunk of the vehicle.

I advised Serrano of his Miranda rights, stating that he had the right to remain silent, that anything he said could be used against him in a court of law, that he had the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before questioning and to have one with him during questioning, and that if he could not afford a lawyer, one would be provided by the Commonwealth at no cost. I further explained that he could decide to stop answering questions at any time. When asked if he understood these rights, Serrano responded, "Yes, sir." Following this, he continued to deny knowledge of the vehicle's contents.

Officers conducted a search of Serrano and the vehicle. During the search, officers recovered a plastic container. The contents of this container were tested and determined to be a large quantity of cocaine, weighing roughly 68.1 grams. Based on these findings, Mr. Serrano was placed under arrest and is facing charges related to trafficking cocaine and operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license. He was set to be arraigned at East Boston District Court.
