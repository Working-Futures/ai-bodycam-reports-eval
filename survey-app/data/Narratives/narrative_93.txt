Narrative:
On Thursday, February 29, 2024, at around 6:08 p.m., I was on routine patrol with the East Boston Anti-Crime Unit near Maverick Square. We observed a motor vehicle fail to stop at a red light at the intersection of Visconti and Paris Street. We conducted a traffic stop and identified the vehicle's single occupant as Gentry Serrano, a 29-year-old male from Malden. During the stop, we determined that Serrano was operating the vehicle with a suspended license. We ordered Serrano to exit the vehicle; he verbally expressed hesitation, stating he could not "avoid this right now," but was subsequently removed from the vehicle.

During our interaction, Serrano claimed the vehicle was not his, though he acknowledged it was registered to him and another individual. He repeatedly asked if we could tow the car and allow him to leave to attend work, stating he had an open court case and feared there might be items in the vehicle he was unaware of. An officer on scene advised Serrano of his Miranda rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. Serrano verbally acknowledged that he understood these rights by stating, "Yes, sir."

Officers conducted a search of Serrano and the vehicle. During the search, we recovered a plastic container. The contents of the container were tested and determined to be a large quantity of cocaine, weighing roughly 68.1 grams. Based on the investigation, Serrano was placed under arrest and charged with trafficking-related offenses involving cocaine and operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license. He is set to be arraigned at East Boston District Court.
