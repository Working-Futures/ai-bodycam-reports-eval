Narrative:
On Tuesday, January 24, 2023, around 7 p.m., officers on patrol in the area of 11 West Selden Street observed a vehicle with a revoked registration. We initiated a traffic stop and identified the owner of the vehicle as 52-year-old Ricky Chesson of Mattapan. Upon making contact with Chesson, I asked if he had his license and registration. He responded, "No, I don't have a license," and explained that he lived nearby at 15 West Southern. When asked again if he had the registration with him, Chesson replied, "Nope." During a subsequent search, officers recovered a Glock 19 loaded with 17 rounds of ammunition.

Chesson was placed under arrest without incident. I then administered Miranda warnings to him. I stated, "Miranda Walton [sic], before we ask you any questions, you have the right... to remain silent." I advised him that anything he chose to say could be used against him in a court of law, that he had the right to consult with a lawyer before answering any questions, and to have that lawyer present during questioning. I further explained that if he could not afford a lawyer, one would be provided to him at no cost, and that if he decided to answer questions, he could stop at any time. When asked if he understood what I told him, Chesson replied, "Yes, sir."

Following the advisement of rights, Chesson asked if he would get bail tonight. I informed him that the matter would be handled at the station and that I was going to call a bail magistrate. Chesson was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of a large capacity firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, operating after suspension, operating after revoked registration, failure to maintain insurance, and possession of a Class B substance.
