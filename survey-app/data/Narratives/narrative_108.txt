Narrative:
I initiated contact with an individual for [INSERT: basis for initial stop/encounter]. I asked the subject if he had a license and registration with him. He replied, "No, I don't have a license," and stated he lived at 15 West Southern. When asked again regarding the registration, he answered, "Nope," and explained that he was selling the car. During the investigation, I remarked that an item was located "right down at the seat." It was also noted that the subject stated he did not have a weapon on him.

I asked the subject if he was ready and then proceeded to read him his Miranda rights. I advised him that he had the right to remain silent, that anything he said may be used against him in a court of law, and that he had the right to consult with a lawyer before answering any questions. I further explained that he could have a lawyer present during questioning, that one would be provided at no cost if he could not afford one, and that if he decided to answer questions, he could stop at any time. When asked if he understood what I told him, the subject responded, "Yes, sir."

Mr. Chesson was placed under arrest without incident. He was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of a large capacity firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, operating after suspension, operating after revoked registration, failure to maintain insurance, and possession of a Class B substance. Mr. Chesson subsequently asked if he would get bail that night. I informed him that we would handle it at the station and that I was going to call a bail magistrate.
