Narrative:
I initiated contact with a male subject, [INSERT: Subject Name], who was seated in the driver's seat of a vehicle. I observed that the subject's seatbelt was positioned such that it was "buckled in, but not actually buckled in," which the subject admitted was done because the car "beeps." The subject identified the vehicle as his father's car. During the interaction, it was noted that the vehicle’s inspection sticker was red. It was stated that technically the vehicle was not supposed to be driven or leave the location due to the inspection status.

I asked the subject to open the vehicle door. After a brief exchange regarding whether the door opened from the inside, the door was opened. I asked the subject if he had "anything crazy" on him, to which he replied, "No." I asked the subject, "Do you mind if I check quick?" The subject provided verbal consent to the search, stating, "Yeah, you go."

During the check of the subject's person, I instructed the subject to "Stop, stop, stop." The subject stated, "I'm not doing that." I located a firearm in the subject's pocket. Upon securing the item, I asked the subject, "Is this loaded?" and remarked, "We don't want to go off." The subject acknowledged the situation, stating, "I got it." I subsequently asked if there was anything else in the car. [INSERT: Details regarding arrest, evidence seizure, and transport].
