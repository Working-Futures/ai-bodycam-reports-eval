Narrative:
My partner, [INSERT: Partner Name], and I received information that a male subject had supposedly dropped an item, possibly a gun. Upon locating a subject matching the description, I called out "Wait up!" and "Yo!" multiple times. My partner and I both ordered the subject to "Come here." The subject complied, and I asked him for his name and where he was coming from. I asked the subject if he had anything on him, and he responded, "No."

I instructed the subject to spread his feet. I explained that someone had reported he was carrying something he should not be carrying and asked if there was anything on him that we needed to know about. I then gave the order to put the subject in handcuffs. I stated that we needed detectors. A firearm was subsequently recovered at the location of Kingston and Bedford. My partner asked the subject if he had a license to carry.

I contacted dispatch to report our location at the corner of Kingston and Bedford and requested Alpha Detectives and a PS, confirming that we had a firearm recovered. My partner verbally confirmed that the firearm was recovered at that location. I requested that my partner obtain the contact information for a witness, identified as a private security guard. My partner confirmed that this security guard, who works for a nearby building, was sitting across from the location and stated that he saw the subject drop the object.
