Narrative:
I approached the subject vehicle and made contact with the driver, [INSERT: Driver Name]. I requested that the driver lower the rear window to verify if there were other passengers; he complied, and I observed he was the sole occupant. I pointed out to the driver that his inspection sticker was approximately two years old. I observed that he was operating the vehicle and inquired about his destination. The driver stated he was on his way to pick up his son in Dorchester near Gallatin Boulevard. I instructed the driver to wait momentarily.

I subsequently asked the driver to step out of the vehicle. I informed the driver that his license was suspended. The driver claimed he did not know that his license was suspended. I asked him when he was last stopped for the suspended license. I inquired if he had anything on his person that I should know about, to which he responded, "I don't know." Upon further questioning regarding how much money he possessed, he estimated he had approximately $400. I instructed the driver to move out of the street.

I contacted dispatch as unit Charlie 113 and requested an "easy tow" to the location of Cummins and Harvard. Following a search of the driver, I confirmed with my partner that they were satisfied with the search. I then asked the driver to sit in our patrol vehicle, and he complied.
