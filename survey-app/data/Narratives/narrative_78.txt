Narrative:
On Monday, March 25, 2024, at about 7:15 p.m., officers assigned to District B3, Mattapan, were on patrol in the area of 572 Cummins Highway. We observed a motor vehicle operating with a cracked windshield and found that the vehicle had not passed inspection in over 21 months. I made contact with the operator, identified as Lamar Tillery of Hyde Park. Due to limited visibility, I asked Tillery to lower the back window. Tillery stated he was driving to Gallatin Boulevard in Dorchester to pick up his son. 

After making contact, officers determined that the suspect's driver's license was suspended. I informed Tillery of the suspension, and he stated, "Oh, I did not know that." We requested the suspect to step out of the vehicle and placed him under arrest. I asked Tillery if he had anything on him we should know about, to which he replied, "I don't know." When asked how much money he possessed, he estimated approximately $400. I utilized radio call sign Charlie 113 to request a tow truck to the intersection of Cummins and Harvard. During a booking search, officers recovered multiple plastic bags believed to be containing heroin and crack cocaine, as well as approximately $907 in U.S. currency. Tillery was charged with drug-related offenses.
