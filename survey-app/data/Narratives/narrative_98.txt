Narrative:
We were heading down to the vicinity of 204 [INSERT: Street/Location Name] to make contact with a subject. Upon arrival, I informed the individual, later identified as Parrish Butler, that he was under arrest. Mr. Butler asked why he could not call anyone and asked, "What are you going to pull me over for?" I instructed him to stop. I requested a transport unit to 206 for the gang unit. While detained, Mr. Butler shouted to a bystander he addressed as "brody," asking him to go to his "crib" and tell his people what happened at the scene. I then instructed another officer to check the rest of the car, which the assisting officer confirmed they would do.

I read Mr. Butler his Miranda rights. I advised him that he had the right to remain silent, that anything he said could be used against him in a court of law, that he had the right to consult with a lawyer before answering any questions, and that he could have a lawyer present during questioning. I further advised that if he could not afford a lawyer, one would be provided by the Commonwealth without cost. I asked Mr. Butler if he understood what I told him, and the response was, "Yep." I then informed him that he could waive his right to counsel and silence, or stop answering questions at any time. Following this advisement, Mr. Butler stated, "I don't have a license," and added, "I don't know what you're talking about."

Mr. Butler was arrested on sight. The basis for the arrest included charges for carrying a firearm without a license (subsequent offense), carrying a loaded firearm, possession of a large capacity feeding device, and possession of ammunition without an FID card. Mr. Butler was subsequently transported for arraignment at Dorchester District Court.
