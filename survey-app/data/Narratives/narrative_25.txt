Narrative:

I arrived on the scene where an altercation had taken place. I made contact with the suspect and ordered him to sit on the curb. I asked him if he had anything on him, to which he replied, "No," and stated he only had a phone which was located nearby. I instructed the suspect to roll onto his back, then his side, and to lift his knees to his chest. I assisted him to a standing position and then directed him to sit down at a secondary location. I asked the suspect if he was okay or needed an ambulance, but he indicated he did not.

I gathered information regarding the incident from another officer and witnesses on the scene. It was reported that a witness observed the suspect with a knife and ran across the street because a male individual was asking for help. Witnesses observed the suspect pulling a knife on the victim, at which point the victim held the suspect's hand to prevent being stabbed. Officers arrived while the parties were still struggling. The knife involved in the incident was recovered and secured in a police cruiser. Officers also confirmed the existence of video footage capturing the incident. During my interaction with the suspect, he admitted, "I told him I dropped the fucking knife," though he denied attempting to take anything.

I attempted to identify the suspect, who verbally identified himself as "Patrick" [INSERT: Last Name]. He stated he was 29 years old but claimed he did not know his social security number. He stated he was from South Boston but possessed no Massachusetts identification or driver's license. When asked for his address, he pointed nearby and stated he lived "right over there," but could not provide a specific house number. I attempted to locate the suspect's information in the agency database but was unable to find a record. I advised the suspect that we would determine his identity through fingerprints if he continued to provide false information, but he maintained that his name was Patrick and that he had never been arrested.

Based on the witness statements, the recovery of the weapon, and the ongoing struggle observed upon police arrival, the suspect was taken into custody. I advised the suspect that the incident had been captured on video. I ordered him to stand up, and we proceeded to transport him from the scene for booking and identification.
