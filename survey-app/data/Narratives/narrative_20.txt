Narrative:

I made contact with the suspect, [INSERT: Suspect Name], who immediately exclaimed that he thought he was getting "jumped" and repeatedly asked what he had done. I ordered the suspect to roll onto his stomach. The suspect was non-compliant, stating that I did not "get it" and claiming that he could not breathe. He requested an ambulance, stating that he had endocarditis. The suspect insisted that all he did was "stand in front of CBS" and yelled out to an individual named "Owen."

I advised the suspect of his Miranda rights. The suspect interrupted the reading of his rights, stating he was not trying to move away but complaining that his arms and wrists were hurting. I asked the suspect if he had anything on him that would hurt or poke me. I conducted a search of the suspect's person and located a fanny pack underneath his hoodie. The suspect stated the pack contained "Ne-Yo's cookies" and denied possessing any drugs.

The suspect became increasingly agitated, threatening to kill himself and stating he was going to smash his head off the wall. The suspect then smashed his head against the wall. He continued to request an ambulance, claiming he had anal cancer, a blood infection in his heart, and had left a medical facility against medical advice. I confirmed to the suspect that we were getting an ambulance for him and attempted to calm him down.

During the interaction, the suspect accused me of hurting him and claimed his wrist was snapped. I explained that we were trying to search him to ensure he did not have any weapons. I observed that the suspect spit on Officer Kennedy. The suspect continued to scream and struggle while we awaited the arrival of medical personnel.
