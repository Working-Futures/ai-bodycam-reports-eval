Narrative:
I located the male suspect and immediately ordered him to keep his hands up. The suspect repeatedly asked what was happening, and I commanded him to keep his hands up and asked if he had anything on him he should not have. The suspect stated he was relaxed but continued to question the reason for the stop. I explained that someone had called 911 reporting that he had a gun. The suspect denied possessing a gun. During the interaction, a knife was located, and the suspect verbally confirmed, "That's my knife."

[INSERT: Name of assisting officer] attempted to retrieve the suspect's identification from his wallet to identify him. The suspect became verbally aggressive and resistant regarding the handling of his wallet, repeatedly asking why we were touching his ID and wallet and stating, "Don't touch my shit." We advised him that the ID was required for identification purposes. The suspect continued to be non-compliant and verbally abusive, using profanity and calling us derogatory names. He made statements indicating his family "love to sue" and argued about the legal definitions of detention and arrest, claiming he knew the law.

[INSERT: Name of assisting officer] stated the basis for the charge was 26910B, carrying a dangerous weapon during a breach of the peace. When I asked if there was a victim, [INSERT: Name of officer/witness] confirmed there was a victim and stated that the suspect "grabbed it." The suspect was subsequently taken to the police car.
