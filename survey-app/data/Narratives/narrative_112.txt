Narrative: On [INSERT: Date and Time of incident], I was operating in the vicinity of 277 Center and 962 Parker Street on the "13 side." I made contact with an individual identified as James Finch. I ordered Finch to let go of an object he was holding, and he complied without resistance. I instructed Finch to sit on the back of a vehicle while I secured the scene. I confirmed with assisting officers that a firearm had been recovered underneath a vehicle, specifically located under the passenger side. I instructed Officer Dougie to remain with Finch.

I subsequently made contact with a second individual, identified as Randy Pizarro. I asked Pizarro if he had a Miranda card and indicated that I would retrieve one, though the recording does not capture the full reading of the rights. I asked Pizarro if he had any other items on his person. During his detention, Pizarro complained that the ground where he was sitting was wet, so I allowed him to stand up. I coordinated with Officer Mac regarding the scene and confirmed the location of the incident was 962 Parker Street, located behind 277 Center and Heath Street.

In addition to the firearm recovered from under the vehicle, officers seized $1,298 in US currency and 25 bags containing a substance believed to be crack cocaine. Based on the evidence located at the scene, Randy Pizarro of Central Falls, Rhode Island, was placed under arrest.
