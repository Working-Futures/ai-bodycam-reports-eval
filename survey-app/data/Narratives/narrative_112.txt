Narrative:
On Saturday, January 7, 2023, at approximately 2:20 a.m., officers from District B-2 and I made contact with Randy Pizzaro, 31, as part of an ongoing investigation. During the interaction, officers observed Mr. Pizzaro place an object under a vehicle. Upon further investigation of the area underneath the vehicle, specifically under the passenger side, officers recovered a loaded Micro Desert Eagle .380 handgun. The firearm was found to have one round in the chamber and five rounds in the magazine. Mr. Pizzaro was immediately taken into custody.

The incident took place in the vicinity of 962 Parker Street, located behind 277 Center Street near Heath Street. I instructed Mr. Pizzaro to relax and sit on the back of a vehicle while the scene was secured. I spoke with a witness on the scene identified as James Finch, who stated that the car involved belonged to his girlfriend. I asked Mr. Pizzaro for his name and if he had identification in his wallet. Officers present, including Officer Mac and Officer Dougie, assisted at the scene, and a call was made to [INSERT: title/rank] Burrows regarding the incident. During the interaction, officers coordinated to produce a Miranda card, though the full reading is not captured in the recording.

During the custody procedure, Mr. Pizzaro asked, “You set this in your garage, Kyle?” A check of Mr. Pizzaro’s name was conducted. In addition to the recovered firearm, officers recovered $1,298 in cash and 25 bags containing a substance believed to be crack cocaine. Mr. Pizzaro, identified as a resident of Central Falls, Rhode Island, was arrested on the scene on a number of charges stemming from the recovered contraband.
