Narrative:
I made contact with the male subject at [INSERT: specific location] and asked him to accompany me to the police vehicle. The subject complied with my request to walk but stated he was freezing and requested his coat. He also asked that we call his wife, whom he identified as Mary Ann. The subject appeared confused regarding the location of his personal items, initially stating his cane was in the car, then indicating his coat was in the kitchen or the shed. He expressed concern regarding the security of the residence. I identified myself as the supervisor in charge and assured him that the house was "frozen" for an investigation, with officers stationed at the front and back to ensure no one entered or exited the premises.

As we escorted the subject to the parked patrol vehicle, he asked why his wife needed to come, and I explained that she did not have a car. Upon identifying the vehicle, the subject stated, "I think I'm going to be arrested." I instructed the subject to step up and put his hands behind his back. He complied with these commands but asked, "What are you trying to do?" and "Why are you arresting me? I didn't do nothing." I advised him that I had been called to the scene, though I noted I was not fully familiar with his specific situation at that time.

I asked the subject if he had any weapons on his person, and he replied, "No, I don't have anything." I proceeded to conduct a search of his person. During the search, the subject stated he had keys, ten dollars, and a "keynote." I informed him that we would perform another check before placing him inside the vehicle.
