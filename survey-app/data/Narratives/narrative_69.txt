Narrative:
On Wednesday, April 10, 2024, at about 10:13 p.m., officers assigned to District D-4, South End, were in the area of Massachusetts Avenue and Albany Street. We were advised by the District D-4 front desk officer that a victim filed a report for a stolen scooter and that it was tracking in the area. Officers observed a female suspect, later identified as Jody Faria, 41, of Billerica, operating a scooter. When officers approached her, she attempted to flee by driving onto the sidewalk. Officers were able to eventually stop Faria and placed her into handcuffs.

As officers searched Faria, we recovered a large plastic bag containing what was believed to be crack cocaine. It was later determined that the crack cocaine weighed approximately 32 grams. Faria was placed under arrest and charged with trafficking of Class B, possession with intent to distribute Class B, and possession of Class B. During the interaction, officers asked Faria why she did not stop when asked multiple times over the course of six blocks. Faria claimed she bought the scooter "off of someone" and denied knowing she needed to stop.

Officers received information that the owner of the scooter, Brandon O'Donnell, was in the front lobby. Officers confirmed that Faria was in possession of the stolen scooter and was wearing the same jacket and bag associated with the theft. Due to an injury to her face and the presence of blood, officers offered to summon EMS to evaluate Faria. Faria stated, "I don't need to go to the ambulance" and "I'm fine, sir," expressing a desire to be bailed out instead. Officers advised Faria she would need to formally deny medical attention to EMS. Officers subsequently prepared to transport Faria to the station.
