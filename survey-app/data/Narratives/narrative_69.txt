Narrative:
I and other officers attempted to stop a female subject, later identified as Jody [INSERT: Last Name], who was operating a scooter. We instructed the subject to stop multiple times over the course of approximately six blocks. Jody initially failed to comply with these commands but eventually came to a stop. Upon contact, she claimed she had purchased the scooter from someone, but officers disputed this, advising her that the incident would have been a conversation had she actually bought it. It was noted that Jody had been traveling at approximately 20 miles per hour during the pursuit. One officer remarked that they "cramped up" while running after her.

Following the stop, I observed that Jody was bleeding from her face. Officers advised her that the injury was avoidable had she stopped when first instructed. We discussed requesting EMS to evaluate her condition. During this time, Jody repeatedly asked if she would be able to be bailed out. She provided her first name as Jody and was asked for her social security number and birth date. Regarding her injuries, Jody stated, "I'm fine, sir," and "I don't need to go to the ambulance," though she subsequently complained that her legs were killing her and asked if her face looked "bad." Officers advised her on the procedure to deny medical attention to EMS.

During the investigation, the owner of the scooter was present in the front lobby. The owner positively identified Jody, noting she was wearing the "same jacket" and carrying the "same bag." Officers observed that items had come out of Jody's shoes during the incident. An officer estimated the value involved to be approximately $30. We coordinated regarding the transport of the subject and discussed meeting EMS at [INSERT: specific location, likely C6 or T-6] for further processing and report completion.
