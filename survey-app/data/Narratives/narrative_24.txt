Narrative:

I was involved in an incident requiring the detention of a male subject, later identified as Regent Moran. During the initial physical detainment, Moran was non-compliant, prompting me to issue multiple verbal commands to "stop resisting," "stop moving around," and "cut the shit." I struggled to secure his arms, noting at one point that I had control of only one arm while he continued to pull away. Moran complained that the restraints were "mad tight" and that he had no space while positioned against the vehicle. I explained to Moran that his actions of resisting and pulling his arm away were causing the tightness, and I advised him that I was holding him against the car because I did not want to engage in a foot chase if he attempted to flee. I offered to loosen the restraints if he complied and got down on the ground.

During the incident, I communicated with Officer Ramon on channel 13. I confirmed that a firearm had been recovered at the RCC lot. I noted that "they demand to see a license to carry a firearm." Later in the interaction, I requested a transport unit, specifically calling for Vector K-14 or K-23 to respond to the location.

Once the situation was stabilized, I identified myself as [INSERT: Rank/First Name] Scott and confirmed the suspect's identity as Regent Moran. I then read Moran his Miranda warnings in full, advising him of his right to remain silent, that anything he said could be used against him in court, his right to consult with a lawyer before answering questions, and that a lawyer would be provided if he could not afford one. I also advised him that he could waive these rights or stop answering questions at any time. When asked if he understood the rights as explained, Moran replied, "Yeah, it was good."

Following the advisement of rights, we prepared to move Moran. Another officer inquired about the location of Moran's phone, which was located on top of the car. As the investigation continued, officers discussed evidence recovery, noting that an item had been found wrapped in a t-shirt inside a trunk at the "14th hall." Moran engaged in conversation regarding the day of the week, noting that court would be open the following day. I proceeded to coordinate the transport of the subject.
