Narrative:
I arrived on scene and made contact with another officer who advised me that the male subject had already been searched, but instructed me to search him again if I took custody. I approached the subject, greeted him, and instructed him to keep his hands in the front. I conducted a search of the subject's person, instructing him to open his stance and spread his legs. Following the search, I directed the subject to have a seat and took possession of a phone found in his possession. I asked the subject if he was in pain or if he was okay, and he confirmed he was fine.

Officers on scene discussed the transport logistics, confirming that we would be traveling to "FedCorp" [INSERT: specific facility name] and would be followed by marshals identified as Sean and Orange. The subject asked if we were going straight to court, and the other officer confirmed that we were. To facilitate the transfer, we swapped out the handcuffs on the subject. During this process, I asked the subject if he spoke English, to which he replied, "Yeah." I advised him that I was double-locking the cuffs to ensure they were secure. I subsequently asked the subject if he would need an interpreter when he went to court, and he answered, "Yes."

While waiting for the accompanying unit, I checked on the subject's welfare again, asking if he wanted the window down. Another officer mentioned that the subject had been seen earlier walking around and "pretending to be a landscaper." I radioed dispatch as unit Tango Delta 9 to report that I was out on a "Code 19 Tango" at [INSERT: correct spelling of Bradgoo] Street. Once the accompanying unit, identified as a black Jeep driven by an officer identified as Richie, arrived on scene, we initiated the transport by following the black Jeep to the designated location.
