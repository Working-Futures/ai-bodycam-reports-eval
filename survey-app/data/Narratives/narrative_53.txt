Narrative:
I, [INSERT: Officer Name] (Unit Charlie 421), was on scene assisting Unit Charlie 431. I engaged with several individuals present, including subjects identified as Tari and Corey. I repeatedly asked the individuals, "What happened?" and inquired about specific actions taken by the subjects. During the encounter, one individual stated, "I don't know where" and "I don't know nothing," though they later remarked, "I know one person." A statement was made regarding the consumption of a substance, with an individual noting, "I didn't even think it was plastic. I just smoked a little bit."

My partner (Unit Charlie 431) drew my attention to a vehicle that was locked but not fully closed. My partner stated, "You can see it right there without even touching it," and observed that an object was "pointed right at you." Upon this discovery, an individual identified as Speaker 01 stated, "Actually, there might be two." My partner confirmed they could see "at least one" item through the gap and noted the potential presence of a second one off to the side.

I asked if the subject was the registered owner of the vehicle and inquired, "No keys on anybody?" My partner located a key fob nearby, identifying it as a "push to start" fob. My partner also verbally noted the presence of a scale inside the vehicle. My partner attempted to angle their camera to document the items in plain view, stating, "I'm going to put this back in here so they can have pictures." The audio transcript concluded without recording [INSERT: Miranda warnings, arrest actions, or specific charges].
