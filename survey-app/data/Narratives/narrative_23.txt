Narrative:
I arrived on scene at [INSERT: specific location] and engaged with a male suspect. During my initial questioning, I asked the suspect about his history and when he had last visited the location; he responded, "Probably last year." It was determined that the suspect had four outstanding warrants. I communicated with another officer to confirm transport logistics, establishing that due to the suspect having multiple warrants, he would be transported to Nashua Street rather than a district station. I advised the suspect that he was being trespassed from the "pastoral" for three years and needed to sign documents. I instructed him to remove a cup from his hand and warned him not to do anything "stupid." The suspect verbally complied, stating he would not, and I proceeded to place him in handcuffs. He requested his shirt during this process, but I denied the request.

Following the detention, I confirmed with an assisting officer that the suspect had been "mad" and "talking shit" prior to my engagement. I spoke with the suspect, stating that if he treated me with respect, I would treat him with respect, and he agreed. The suspect requested to make a phone call. I explained to him that because of the four active warrants, he would be held at the jail for the weekend, and I described the facilities at Nashua Street. I asked the suspect if he had a job, to which he replied he was "just trying to survive right now."

I conducted a search of the suspect to ensure he possessed no guns or weapons. During the search, I asked the suspect about a specific item he was holding. The suspect replied, "This is my soul." I informed him that we would search the item further once we moved outside. I confirmed with the other officers that there were no additional items in his pockets. I located the suspect's hat in a bag and asked if he wanted to cover his identity, as he mentioned he had just bought a "bow cap." Once the search was complete and the four warrants were reiterated, we prepared to transport the suspect from the scene.
