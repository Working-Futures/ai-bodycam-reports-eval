Narrative:
On [INSERT: Date] at approximately [INSERT: Time], I was involved in a police response near a train station. Officers discussed a plan to "bring him out" and "bring back," noting that we would be able to stop at the train station located on the right. During this transport or coordination, an automated audio announcement stating "Closing, door closing" was audible.

Radio communication ensued regarding the location of a victim. A unit identified as 982 requested that a detective "swing back" and get the victim to proceed to a location referred to as "rock straight cross." Unit State 20 responded that their company had never been off at a "rock straight cross." An officer then asked, "Now, where's your victim at?" Another officer replied that the victim was at the front of the units on the road, stating, "I just found him still on the left side."

Unit Delta 8-1 confirmed contact, stating, "We have him." Subsequently, Unit Delta 103 reported they were close with the victim, advising that their lights were on and that a closure would be visible. The transcript concludes with the units positioned with the victim. [INSERT: Specific details regarding the nature of the incident or identity of the victim].
