Narrative:
I arrived at the scene where a vehicle stop was conducted right outside the entrance to the Michael Cemetery. The driver, [INSERT: Suspect Name], stated he had recently moved from Virginia and was traveling to his wife, Simone Harris', workplace to assist her with a quadriplegic patient. I asked the driver if he had a license, and he complied by answering, "Yes, sir." The investigation revealed that the vehicle's registration had expired on May 31st, a fact the driver acknowledged while speaking on the phone.

The driver was asked to step out of the vehicle. He questioned the necessity of exiting the vehicle and argued that searching his truck was illegal, stating there was no probable cause. He also mentioned a warrant out of Georgia but claimed it was for a misdemeanor and not extraditable. The driver was subsequently placed in handcuffs and informed the person on his phone that he was being locked up.

During the interaction, officers asked the driver about the presence of a firearm. The driver admitted that a firearm, which he described as a 9mm V2 Taurus, was inside the truck. He indicated that the weapon and an empty magazine were located in a bag on or near the seat where an officer was standing. Officers conducted an inventory search of the vehicle and located the firearm and a gun cleaning kit in the specified location. The driver verbally protested the search of his bag, calling it disrespectful, at which point he was advised that it was an inventory search.
