Narrative:
At about 1:31 p.m. on Saturday, April 20, 2024, I, along with officers assigned to District A1 downtown, responded to the Burger King located at 128 Tremont Street near the Boston Common. We were responding to a report of a person with a gun, having been advised by Boston Police Operations that a male displayed a firearm to the cashier inside the store. Upon arrival, we located the suspect, identified as Gerald Sibley [INSERT: DOB/Address if legally required beyond Dorchester], standing in front of the counter.

We placed Sibley into handcuffs and recovered a firearm from his waistband. The firearm was later determined to be a Taurus G2 containing one round in the chamber and eight rounds in a large capacity magazine. Following the detention, Sibley made several statements, claiming, "They gave me some messed up food, yo," and asserting, "I didn't do nothing wrong." He further explained that he was "trying to get everybody's name." Sibley commented, "They behind my back," and requested that we send detectives, to which I responded that I would.

Throughout the interaction, Sibley repeatedly remarked, "You have a license to carry," and ultimately stated, "I'm trying to kill you, man." Based on the facts presented and the evidence recovered, Gerald Sibley was placed under arrest. He was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, unlawful possession of a large capacity feeding device, armed robbery, and resisting arrest.
