Narrative:
I was at [INSERT: location] interacting with an individual identified as [INSERT: suspect name]. The subject repeatedly stated, "They behind my back," and complained that "they gave me some messed up food." He asserted, "I didn't do nothing wrong," and explained that he "was trying to get everybody's name." The subject asked, "Hey, what's this?" and stated, "You have fire armor coming," followed by a remark that "That's the text."

A request was made to "Tell them to send detectives," and the statement "I'll send detectives" was verbalized. The subject then commanded, "Fire, cover that." Subsequently, the subject repeatedly stated, "You have a license to carry." The subject then told me, "I'm trying to kill you, man."
