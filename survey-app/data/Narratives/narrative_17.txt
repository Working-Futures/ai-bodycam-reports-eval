Narrative:
I, Officer [INSERT: Name/Badge Number], along with Officer [INSERT: Partner Name], observed a male suspect, identified as [INSERT: Suspect Name], at the location of 794 Mass Ave. We recognized the suspect from prior arrests and observed him "beefing" with another individual at the scene. We approached the suspect to place him into custody due to an active warrant. During the initial interaction, I heard sounds of exertion and commanded the suspect to "Drop it," "Relax," and "Don't even start." I confirmed the basis of the arrest to him, stating, "You're a warrant, so it's enough."

Subsequent to the arrest, I asked the suspect if he had any contraband on his person before we transported him to Booking. I observed that he had "quite a bit of weight" on him. The suspect initially claimed that the substance was "not even real" and that he "got beat" when purchasing it, implying he had been sold fake drugs. I asked if he thought it was crack or fentanyl. Upon further investigation of the items, the suspect admitted, "No, there's a little bag of crack in it." I also located pills and other bags; the suspect claimed some were not narcotics but confirmed regarding one specific item that "that one is."

During the encounter, the suspect requested to speak to his girlfriend to inform her he was getting arrested. Another officer confirmed he had secured the suspect's phone. The suspect asked for a piece of paper to write down information, but I advised him my book was in my locker. I contacted dispatch via radio as unit Delta K1 to report we were off with one individual at 794 Mass Ave. Dispatch generated line number 242-060-492 for the incident. I subsequently advised dispatch that the suspect was being transported to District B2.
