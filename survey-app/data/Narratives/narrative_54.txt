Narrative:
I engaged with a female individual identified as Khalees Osola regarding the status of her vehicle. Osola confirmed the vehicle was her personal car and explained that she had been stopped regarding her registration. She stated she had a copy of the registration in her backpack but was currently on her way to the hospital. After determining we could verify the information via the license plate, Osola was permitted to leave the scene. I subsequently spoke with a male suspect, [INSERT: Suspect Name], who stated he had moved to Florida three or four years prior and mentioned a previous citation for speeding in the tunnels.

During the investigation, a firearm was identified within the vehicle. I asked the suspect to give me a license to carry a firearm. The suspect stated, "I don't have a license to carry a firearm." Following this statement, I advised the suspect of his Miranda rights, including the right to remain silent, that anything he said could be used against him in a court of law, the right to consult with a lawyer before answering questions, and that if he could not afford a lawyer, one would be provided by the Commonwealth without cost. I further advised him that he could stop answering questions at any time. When asked if he understood what I told him, the suspect replied, "Yes, sir."

I asked the suspect if he had a license to carry a firearm, and he again responded, "No, I don't." When questioned regarding the firearm located in the vehicle, the suspect denied ownership, stating, "I don't even know how it got in there." He claimed the vehicle belonged to "Khaleesi," identifying her as his boss. I informed the suspect that I was going to search him to ensure he possessed no other items. The suspect identified himself as a musician who plays keys. I instructed the suspect to remain in place and adjusted his handcuffs.
