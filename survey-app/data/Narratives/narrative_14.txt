Narrative:
I initiated contact with an unidentified individual and asked if they had an ID, stating that I needed to prove they were above 21. I asked the subject if they had weed on them, and the subject replied, "It's in the bag." I instructed the subject to take the bag off. Following a remark that "the lemon's going off," I told the individual, "So, come on and eat that." I subsequently told an individual to "go in the car."

I advised responding units that they could still come in but to slow it down. Another officer instructed to "get the other kid in the car." I issued a command to "Don't move" and stated that they were all set up for help. I requested assistance, stating, "Hey, can I get some help down here? I'm right in front of you." During an ensuing interaction, the phrase "Put him in my pocket" was repeated multiple times. I warned, "There's more right here, watch out," and then confirmed, "I got it." An officer named Jesus was addressed with the question, "Got him?"

I observed that there was "another guy." Multiple officers on the scene announced the discovery of "two guns" or "two firearms" repeatedly. I requested, "Hey, give me some cops right here." I issued a command to "put it on," likely referring to handcuffs, and stated, "I'm going to secure it." I asked another officer, "Hey, you got both guns?" and they responded, "I got two guns." I stated I was going to secure my gun. An officer asked, "What kind of gun is that?" and confirmed, "I got it on me."
