Narrative:
On [INSERT: Date] at [INSERT: Time], I observed a vehicle turning off of Talbot onto Wells traveling at a high rate of speed, estimated to be approximately 50 miles per hour. I initiated a traffic stop and approached the driver. I asked the driver if he had his license or permit on him. The driver stated that he "might have lost" the paper, which he indicated was his road test. I asked the driver, "What's the rush?" and determined there was no emergency. I inquired about the vehicle's registration and whether the vehicle was rented by his mother. I further asked the driver if there were any weapons or drugs in the vehicle.

After communicating with dispatch as unit Harry 4-4-5, I returned to the subject vehicle. I instructed the driver to turn off the car and to step out of the vehicle "real quick." Upon his exit, I asked if he had any weapons, knives, or needles on him, to which he replied, "No." I asked the driver if he knew his current status. When he expressed he did not know, I informed him that his license was suspended. The driver responded, "Oh, for real?"

I then ordered the subject to stop moving and "stay over there." I instructed the subject to sit down multiple times, stating, "You're being rude to us, so just sit down." A command was then issued for the subject to provide a license to carry a firearm.
