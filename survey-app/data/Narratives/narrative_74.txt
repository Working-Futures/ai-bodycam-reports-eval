Narrative:
At about 4:15 a.m. on Sunday, March 31, 2024, officers assigned to District C-11 Dorchester responded to the area of 4 Sumner Square for a report of a loud party. Upon arrival, officers observed multiple vehicles illegally parked on the sidewalk on both sides of the street. We could hear loud music and observed a large group of about 70 individuals. Officers advised the group to leave the area multiple times, which they refused to do. As officers attempted to clear the street, we instructed individuals to "keep it moving" and "take a walk."

During the engagement, officers encountered resistance from several individuals. A female subject, later identified as Stephanie Ilma, was advised that she was "out of control" and "has to go." Ilma argued that she shouldn't be arrested and claimed that someone "hit the shit out of" her knee. Officers ordered another individual to "back up out of her face." The situation escalated into a physical altercation involving Ilma and others, during which officers issued commands to "stop kicking." Multiple parties were heard shouting "don't touch me," and Ilma alleged that her hair was broken during the struggle.

Officers subsequently arrested Luca Del Guado Santos (20, of Mattapan), Stephanie Ilma (24, of Mattapan), and Miguel Martinez (20, of Boston). They were charged with various offenses including assault and battery on a police officer, resisting arrest, interfering with a police officer, disorderly conduct, and disturbing the peace. As the remaining crowd dispersed, a male individual alleged that a "dude swung his speaker" and injured his kneecap. I then received reports regarding a fight outside at 59 [INSERT: street name]. The provided audio transcript does not contain documentation regarding whether Miranda warnings were read to the arrestees.
