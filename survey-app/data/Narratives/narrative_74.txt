Narrative:
I arrived on the scene of a disturbance at approximately 4:00 AM regarding reports of a fight outside. Upon contact with the involved parties, I issued multiple commands for individuals to "keep it moving" and "take a walk." One individual, [INSERT: Name/Description of Subject 1], apologized, while another subject, [INSERT: Name/Description of Subject 2], stated, "I promise you I will... take a walk because I shouldn't be arrested." During this interaction, [INSERT: Name of Subject 2] alleged that another party had struck their knee. An individual on the scene stated that a female subject was "out of control" and that "she has to go."

The interaction escalated into a physical confrontation during which commands were issued to "stop kicking." The subject became non-compliant, repeatedly screaming "No" and "Don't touch me," while directing profanity and racial slurs at me. Following the struggle, I requested a cruiser to the location to transport the subject. I requested that bystanders move a vehicle to facilitate the arrival of the police cruiser.

During the subsequent investigation on the scene, I spoke with an involved party to clarify the earlier statements regarding the leg injury. The individual stated, "The dude swung his speaker and fucking took my kneecap off." I observed that the female subject involved appeared to be intoxicated, noting, "We know she's drunk." I then proceeded to clear the area, instructing the remaining group to leave and asking how they were getting home, informing them that the "party's done." I advised dispatch that I was on the scene at [INSERT: Address/Location Number 59] regarding the fight.
