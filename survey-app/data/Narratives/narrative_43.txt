Narrative:
Officers discussed call notes regarding a "Bravo 415" which indicated that a male and a female were involved. An officer advised an individual identified as "Eddie" to call for another unit. During the encounter with the subjects, an officer stated, "You guys are going to the same jail." One subject was specifically told, "He's going to jail with you," and "You're going to jail." While escorting a subject, an officer instructed them to "Watch your step." The subject remarked, "You're fucking hating me," to which the officer replied, "Watch yourself, man." [INSERT: whether Miranda warnings were provided].

An officer noted the sequence "2-5-6-4-2" and initially observed that the vehicle appeared occupied twice, though it was later stated that there were "three people on it." An officer stated, "We're going to want an FIO." The officers navigated the area, identifying the location as Hemingway coming up to Boylston. A radio transmission indicated that unit Bravo 803 was following a suspect vehicle from a shooting yesterday, described as a white VW Atlas, in the area of Hemenway and Fenway. An officer asked if there was "anything to that Bower Street shooting" and noted that "fingerprints needed to dial it in," clarifying that the stop was "about the occupants." An officer subsequently asked for the location of an individual identified as "Mike." [INSERT: details regarding the arrest charges or evidence collection].
