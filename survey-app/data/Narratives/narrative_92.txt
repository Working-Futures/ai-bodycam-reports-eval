Narrative: Officers requested the suspect to climb down from a fire escape. Initially, the suspect complied, but he then scrambled back up the ladder in an attempt to flee custody. Officers observed the suspect jump off the fire escape and chased after him on foot at street level. I observed the suspect, later identified as Calvin Feeney, near [INSERT: specific street number or location] on Coldfoot Street and Pentecost Street. Feeney was verbally non-compliant during the pursuit, and I asked him if he was going to run, stating he should have listened.

Upon apprehending Feeney, officers ordered him to sit down. When asked if he had anything on him, Feeney stated, "I don't have anything on me besides the knife," and indicated it was in his jacket pocket. During a search of his person, an assisting officer located marijuana in his jacket pocket. An assisting officer also located a gun on the ground nearby. Feeney claimed he was in the area because he "wanted to get a picture of the sunrise" and stated he ran because he "didn't want to get in trouble for trespassing." An officer noted that Feeney’s presence had put a female witness in fear.

Feeney initially identified himself as "Dean," but subsequently identified himself as Calvin Feeney from Douglas, Massachusetts. He complained that his left shoulder was "messed up." An officer read Feeney his Miranda rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. Feeney acknowledged the communication by asking what he was being arrested for. He was informed he was being arrested for trespassing. Feeney was placed into a transport wagon and charged with attempt to commit a crime, breaking and entering in the daytime, disturbing the peace, and resisting arrest.
