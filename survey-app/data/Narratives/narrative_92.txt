Narrative: On Saturday, February 17th, 2024, at about 7 a.m., I, along with other officers assigned to Boston's District A1, responded to a radio call regarding a person wearing all black and a black ski mask climbing up a fire escape ladder in the area of Cooper Street and Lynn Street. Upon arrival, we observed the suspect on the fire escape on the Thatcher Street side of the building. Officers requested the suspect to climb down. Initially, the suspect complied, but he then scrambled back up the ladder in an attempt to flee custody. We knew the fire escape led to another street, so we followed him on street level. Officers observed the suspect jump off the fire escape and chased him on foot. We apprehended the suspect, later identified as Calvin Feeney, 24, of Douglas, Massachusetts, in the area of Pentecost Street.

When detained, Mr. Feeney stated that he just wanted to get a picture of the sunrise and ran because he did not want to get in trouble for trespassing, though he admitted it was "stupid" to run. When asked if he had anything on his person, Mr. Feeney stated he had a knife in his jacket pocket. A knife was located, and an officer also noted the presence of marijuana in a jacket pocket. During the search of the area, an officer stated, "We've got a gun on the ground, sir."

I advised Mr. Feeney that he was being locked up. I read him his Miranda rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to counsel. Mr. Feeney asked what he was being arrested for. I informed him that he was under arrest and charged with attempt to commit a crime, breaking and entering in the daytime, disturbing the peace, and resisting arrest. A transport wagon was called to the scene. Mr. Feeney confirmed he had his wallet and money, and he requested to be buckled into the wagon. He was secured in the vehicle for transport to the station to be booked.
