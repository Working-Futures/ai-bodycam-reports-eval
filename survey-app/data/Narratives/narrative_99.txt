Narrative: On Thursday, January 18, 2024, around 2:56 a.m., officers in the area of 488 Blue Hill Avenue received an alert of a single round fired in the immediate area. Upon arrival, we observed no occupied vehicles and only a single male in the vicinity of the alert, later identified as Lamar Lovett. We observed that Mr. Lovett was panting and out of breath, as if he had been running. Due to the lack of other witnesses, we decided to stop and speak with him. I asked Mr. Lovett where he lived, and he responded, "36 Maple Street." When asked if he heard any loud bangs or possessed a gun, he replied, "No." Mr. Lovett mentioned he had his keys, but he repeatedly reached for his pockets during the interaction.

Due to Mr. Lovett's behavior, I informed him that I was going to pat him down and instructed him to put his hands behind his back. Upon completing the search, officers recovered a Thames Arms Company .38 caliber revolver capable of holding five rounds. The firearm had no serial number and was loaded with five rounds and one spent shell casing. I asked Mr. Lovett if the item was a loaded firearm and requested his license to carry. Mr. Lovett admitted, "I don't have a license."

I subsequently read Mr. Lovett his Miranda rights from a card, advising him of his right to remain silent and his right to consult with a lawyer. When asked if he understood what I had told him, [INSERT: Mr. Lovett's response]. I asked Mr. Lovett if he shot at somebody or if we needed to look for a body, and he answered, "No." Mr. Lovett was arrested on the scene and charged with carrying a firearm without a license, possession of ammunition without an FID card, and carrying a loaded firearm.
