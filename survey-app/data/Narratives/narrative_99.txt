Narrative:
Officers approached the subject, identified as Lovett, and observed that he was panting and appeared out of breath, as if he had been running. When asked if he was out of breath, Lovett stated, "Oh, I'm cold." I asked Lovett where he lived, and he responded, "36 Maple Street," adding that he had his keys. I asked if he had heard any loud bangs or if he had a gun or any weapons on him, to which he replied, "No." Lovett repeatedly reached for his pockets, which caused us to initiate a search of his person.

I informed Lovett, "I'm just going to pat you down," and confirmed again that he did not have weapons. Upon completing the search, I recovered a firearm. I asked Lovett, "Is that loaded?" and ordered him to put his hands behind his back. Lovett complied, stating, "Alright, man." The recovered weapon was identified as a Thames Arms Company .38 caliber revolver with no serial number. The firearm was capable of holding five rounds and was found to be loaded with five rounds and one spent shell casing.

I asked Lovett for his license to carry a firearm. Lovett stated, "I don't have a license." I verified by asking, "You don't have a license to carry a firearm?" and he confirmed, "No." I then utilized a Miranda card to read Lovett his rights, including the right to remain silent, the warning that anything said can be used against him in court, the right to consult with a lawyer before and during questioning, and the right to stop questioning at any time. I asked Lovett if he understood what I told him.

Following the advisement of rights, I asked Lovett if he had shot at anyone or if I needed to look for a body or person. Lovett replied, "No." Lovett was arrested on the scene and charged with carrying a firearm without a license, possession of ammunition without an FID card, and carrying a loaded firearm.
