Narrative:
At approximately 6:35 p.m. on Sunday, February 25, 2024, I, along with other officers assigned to District C-6, South Boston, was dispatched to 22 Liberty Drive for reports of vandalism in progress. Upon arrival, we were informed that the suspect, identified as David Gong (33, of Newton), had arrived at the establishment in an intoxicated state. I spoke with the bartender, Michael, who stated that Gong sat at the bar and appeared clearly intoxicated. Michael advised Gong that he could not serve him alcohol but offered him food and water. In response, Gong threw his water at the bar and then proceeded to the restroom.

I interviewed the Assistant General Manager, Philippe [INSERT: Last Name], who confirmed that Gong had been removed from the premises in the past for drinking outside alcohol. Philippe stated that after Gong entered the restroom, he engaged in destructive behavior. When Gong exited the stall, he informed a staff member named Daniela that there was a fire in the bathroom. Philippe entered the restroom and observed that a stack of paper towels inside the trash barrel had been lit on fire. Philippe began throwing water on the flames. The incident resulted in damage to the trash barrel, the lid, and the faucet. Boston Fire Department responded to the scene and extinguished the fire.

Officers successfully located Gong outside the establishment. Based on the investigation and witness statements, we placed David Gong under arrest. He is charged with attempted arson, destruction of property, burning of a public building, burning of personal property, attempt to burn a public building, attempted arson of a dwelling house, and malicious destruction of property.
