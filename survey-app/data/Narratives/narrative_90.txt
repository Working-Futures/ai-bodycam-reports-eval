Narrative: I arrived at the scene and made contact with the Assistant General Manager, identified as Philippe [INSERT: last name]. Philippe informed me that a male subject, whom he recognized from a previous incident involving the consumption of outside alcohol, had entered the establishment. Philippe described the suspect as a heavy-set Asian male in his mid-30s, approximately 5'9", with short hair, wearing a grayish-bluish sweater. Philippe stated that the suspect exited a bathroom stall and told an employee named Daniela that there was a fire in the stall. Philippe stated he ran into the bathroom, observed a stack of paper towels lit on fire inside the trash barrel, and threw water on the flames to extinguish them.

I observed damage to the trash can, the trash can lid, and the faucet. Philippe advised that the suspect appeared to have mental issues or was "crazy" based on his behavior. I also spoke with the bartender, identified as Michael. Michael stated that the suspect sat at the bar, but Michael refused to serve him due to the previous incident where the suspect was drinking a "nip" inside the business. Michael reported that after being refused service, the suspect threw water on the bar and then proceeded to the bathroom. Michael corroborated the suspect's description, adding that the male was wearing jeans and glasses and appeared clearly intoxicated.

Philippe noted that there are security cameras in the establishment, but stated they would likely only show the back of the suspect's head rather than his face. I gathered the suspect's description and business information from the staff. Personnel on scene utilized a fan to ventilate the smoke from the area.
