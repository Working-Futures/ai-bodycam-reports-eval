Narrative: Officers responded to the area of 1950 Washington Street in District D4, South End, regarding a report of an assault with a knife. We were advised that a victim had been stabbed 12 days prior and had observed the suspect in the area. We were provided with an ID wanted flyer for a suspect involved in a stabbing that occurred at 10:36 p.m. on Thursday, February 1st, in the area of 1917 Washington Street.

Upon arrival and investigation at the scene, officers engaged with individuals to identify the suspect. A description was discussed regarding a tall male wearing "dark clothing" and a "dark beanie." One individual on scene pointed out a specific male, stating, "That man right there," and alleged, "He hit the guy," and "He hit me also." A request was made regarding the availability of a Spanish translator during the interaction.

Following further investigation, Jerome Brown, 43, of Brockton, was placed under arrest and charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Brown was non-compliant with the concept of his detention, repeatedly asking, "I just want to know why I'm getting locked up," and stating, "I didn't do nothing." Brown claimed, "I have no weapons on me," and stated, "All I have is my little bit of weed." He further remarked, "They're lying on me," and expressed concern regarding his mother's anniversary the following day. A bystander at the scene was heard referring to an individual as a "rat." Brown was secured for transport in the wagon.
