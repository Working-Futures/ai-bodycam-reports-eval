Narrative:
I arrived on scene and made contact with a male individual who stated, "I'm not running from no goddamn body," and reported that a male subject had hit him, though he remarked, "I don't know what he hit him with." The victim appeared to be injured, stating, "I'm all bloody," and requested assistance with bandaging a wound. The victim described the suspect as a tall male wearing dark clothing and a dark beanie, specifically noting a hairstyle involving a "big long strip," and indicated the suspect had fled "by the store way." An officer on scene asked if a Spanish translator was needed, to which another individual replied affirmatively.

Officers located a subject matching the provided description nearby. A records check was conducted, which an officer noted came back "clean." The victim confirmed the subject’s identity, clarifying that the suspect had been standing during the incident rather than sitting. Upon contact, the suspect stated, "I don't drink, officer," and repeatedly asked, "What did I do, sir?" The suspect admitted, "I have an open case," but insisted he did not have a warrant and claimed he does not fight anyone.

The suspect identified the victim, pointing and stating, "That man right there," and alleged that the victim "hit me also." The suspect was subsequently placed into the police wagon. During this process, the suspect denied any wrongdoing, stating, "I didn't do nothing," and "They're lying on me." He voluntarily stated, "All I have is my little bit of weed that I smoke... I have gum... I have no weapons on me." He explained his presence by claiming he only approached because a female had asked him to give her his phone. A witness on scene referred to the suspect as "a whole rat."
