Narrative:
Officers approached the scene and immediately issued loud verbal commands for an individual to get "on the ground" and to "watch the door." The subject was ordered to "open the door" and place his "chest on the ground." The subject complied with the commands to stay on the ground. Once the subject was secured, an officer conducted a search of his person, asking, "Nothing on you?" and checking if there was "anything in [his] shoes." Officers then physically manipulated the subject's position, instructing him to sit on his "ass" and hold his foot. Officers coordinated a lifting maneuver, counting "one, two, three" to "rock" the subject, while instructing him to "slow it down" and "don't move."

The subject asked, "Can I ask what this is?" and was initially told, "We'll tell you in a moment." An officer questioned the subject's identity, asking, "Rondo, right?" The subject replied, "No, Ayub." An officer then informed the subject, "Ayub, you have warranty," indicating the basis for the detention. The subject responded, "I'll take it. That's my area," and an officer confirmed he had "the list right here." Following this, officers coordinated on-scene logistics, with one stating he was "not going to get the box" but would "start getting [his] stuff going." A brief administrative check regarding "RBA" was conducted, to which the answer was "No."
