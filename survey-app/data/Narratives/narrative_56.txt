Narrative:
I approached the suspect, who was in possession of a dirt bike. I issued immediate verbal commands, instructing the suspect to "Come here," "Take your hand off the dirt bike," "Get off," and "Put your hand behind your back." I physically secured the suspect, stating, "I got him," as the suspect was detained. I advised the suspect that he was under arrest. A verbal dispute ensued with the suspect or a bystander regarding the status of the arrest; the individual argued that the suspect "wasn't driving" and was only detained. I responded that the suspect could not drive the vehicle on the street and stated that the basis for the encounter included the fact that "He tried to flee on us," which I identified as a violation of the law. I dismissed the claim that the suspect did not know we were approaching.

During the detention, I observed the suspect behaving suspiciously regarding a bag in his possession. I asked, "What's in this bag that you want to get rid of so bad?" noting that he was attempting to discard it. I ordered bystanders to "Get rid of their bike" and to move back. I examined the bag and noted there was "something hard" inside. Upon further inspection, I discovered a firearm, stating, "Yeah, there's a gun in this bag, too."

I communicated with Officer "Charlie" regarding the situation and the evidence. I addressed the suspect regarding his licensure, asking to see a "license period and fire up" [INSERT: specific license type intended, likely License to Carry]. The response provided was that the individual possessed "Just a permit." I concluded that the suspect did "Don't have a license" for the weapon. The evidence was seized, and I indicated that we would "wrap it" and place it "in the back." No Miranda warnings were recorded in the provided transcript.
