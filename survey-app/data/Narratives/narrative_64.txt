Narrative: At about 2:15 a.m. on Thursday, April 18, 2024, while assigned to District B-2, Roxbury, I was on patrol with other Austin police officers in the area of Columbia Road. We observed a motor vehicle operating at a high rate of speed and activated our marked cruiser's emergency lights and sirens to initiate a traffic stop. Upon approaching the vehicle, we immediately observed multiple empty alcohol bottles inside, with one situated in the front cup holder. The operator, identified as James Perry, Jr., was unable to locate a registration for the vehicle. He stated he was coming from his girlfriend's house in Norwood and trying to get to his mother. When asked about the alcohol, Perry denied drinking, stating the bottles belonged to his girlfriend and he forgot to remove them, offering to take a breathalyzer test. During the interaction, I instructed Perry to stop reaching around the car and to turn the vehicle off.

We determined that Perry’s driver's license was expired. I requested that he exit the vehicle, informing him that he did not have a valid license. Perry asked if he was being arrested, and I advised him that he was under arrest for unlicensed operation. I instructed him to leave his belongings in the car. Perry refused to exit the vehicle voluntarily, and officers were forced to assist him out. During the attempt to remove him, Perry attempted to flee from officers, knocking body cameras to the ground. A foot pursuit ensued, and we requested assistance from responding units to apprehend the suspect.

Officers converged on the area, identified as Hamilton and Mount Everest (later referenced as Hamilton and Oliver), and were able to stop Perry. He continued to resist officers as we attempted to place him into handcuffs, but he was eventually secured. Officers led him back to an awaiting cruiser for transport. [INSERT: Whether Miranda warnings were provided].

Subsequent to the arrest, officers recovered a firearm from inside Perry's backpack. The weapon was determined to be a Springfield XD9 with one round in the chamber and 11 rounds in the magazine. The magazine was identified as a high-capacity device capable of holding 13 rounds. Perry was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, unlawful possession of a large-capacity feeding device, unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle, and resisting arrest.
