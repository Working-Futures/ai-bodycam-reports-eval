Narrative:

I initiated a traffic stop on a vehicle in the area of Hamilton Street and Mount Everest. I made contact with the driver, initially addressing him as Robert Hamilton, and asked, "Did you just answer the wheel?" I requested his license and registration. The driver apologized, stating, "Oh, fast, man. Sorry, bro," and explained he was rushing to get the car to his mother. He stated he was coming from his girlfriend's house in Norwood but could not provide a specific address for his mother, claiming she lived right next to him but had just moved. During our interaction, the driver was unable to locate the vehicle's registration. I observed items in the vehicle that led me to ask if he had been drinking; the driver denied this, stating the items belonged to his girlfriend and offering to take a breathalyzer test.

Assisting officers on scene instructed the driver to stop reaching around the vehicle and to turn the car off. It was determined that the driver did not possess a valid driver's license. I instructed the driver to exit the vehicle. When he asked why, he was informed it was due to the lack of a valid license. I ordered him to leave his belongings in the car. The driver asked if he was getting arrested, and I confirmed he was under arrest for unlicensed operation.

As officers attempted to take the subject into custody, he attempted to flee, causing body-worn cameras to be knocked to the ground. A foot pursuit ensued, and assistance was requested from responding officers to apprehend the suspect. Officers converged on the area and were able to stop the suspect, who continued to resist officers as we attempted to place him into handcuffs. He was eventually secured and led back to an awaiting cruiser for transport.

During a search, officers recovered a firearm from inside the suspect's backpack. The weapon was determined to be a Springfield XD9 with one round in the chamber and 11 rounds in the magazine. The magazine was identified as a high-capacity feeding device capable of holding 13 rounds. The suspect, identified as Perry Jr., was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, unlawful possession of a large-capacity feeding device, unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle, and resisting arrest. Incoming units were advised to slow down as the situation was stabilized.
