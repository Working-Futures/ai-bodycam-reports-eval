Narrative:
My partner and I initiated a traffic stop on a vehicle near the intersection of New England Avenue and Talbot Avenue for speeding approximately 20 miles per hour over the 25 mile per hour limit, as well as for window tints and a plate cover. I approached the driver, identified as Jordan Williams, who disputed the reason for the stop, claiming he was driving behind a truck and not speeding. I observed that Mr. Williams was shaking and holding his hands in a nervous manner. I asked Mr. Williams to step out of the vehicle. As he exited, I observed an item I described as a "box cut" on the seat and asked if there were any other weapons in the car. I conducted a pat-down of Mr. Williams, during which he stated that I "grabbed [him] up a little bit." I asked Mr. Williams if he possessed a License to Carry (LTC), to which he replied, "No, I don't."

I placed Mr. Williams in handcuffs and advised him of his Miranda rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to counsel. Mr. Williams acknowledged understanding his rights but continued to ask if he could call someone to retrieve his vehicle. During a search of the vehicle, officers located a loaded Ruger SR-22, a .22 caliber firearm, which contained 10 rounds of ammunition in the magazine. Additionally, officers found pills on the front seat described as "fake Adderall" or "Perk 30s," believed to be a Class E substance.

Mr. Williams was placed under arrest and charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, and possession with intent to distribute a Class E substance. We determined the vehicle could be legally parked on the side of the road, and Mr. Williams provided the passcode to his phone so we could contact his father to retrieve the vehicle. Mr. Williams was subsequently transported to B3 for booking.
