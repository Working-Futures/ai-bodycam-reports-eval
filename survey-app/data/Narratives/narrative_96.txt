Narrative:
On Tuesday, October 11, 2022, around 2:11 p.m., officers with Boston's B3 District, Mattapan, conducted a traffic stop in the area of 52 Talbot Avenue in Dorchester. We initiated the stop due to the vehicle's window tints and because I estimated the driver was speeding approximately 20 miles per hour over the 25 miles per hour speed limit as the vehicle passed us near New England Avenue. The driver, later identified as Jordan Williams, 22, of Dorchester, was argumentative regarding the basis of the stop, denying he was speeding and claiming he was stuck behind another vehicle. During our interaction, I observed that Williams appeared to be shaking. I observed an item on the seat and asked Williams if he had a glove box, then requested him to step out of the vehicle.

Upon Williams exiting the vehicle, I conducted a frisk for weapons, during which Williams stated I "grabbed" him. I asked Williams if he possessed a License to Carry (LTC), to which he replied, "No, I don't." An officer then advised Williams of his Miranda rights, including his right to remain silent and his right to counsel. Williams acknowledged these rights. During the subsequent search, officers found Williams to be in possession of a loaded Ruger SR-22, a .22 caliber firearm containing a magazine with 10 rounds of ammunition. Additionally, we located pills on the front seat believed to be a Class E substance, specifically described as fake Adderall or "Perk 30s."

Williams was placed under arrest and charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, and possession with intent to distribute a Class E substance. Williams requested to call a family member to retrieve his vehicle, stating his father was five minutes away. We agreed to allow the arrangement provided the vehicle could be parked legally. Williams was subsequently transported to the B3 District for booking.
