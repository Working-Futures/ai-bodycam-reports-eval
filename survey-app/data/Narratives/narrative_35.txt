Narrative:
I arrived on the scene where subjects were detained regarding a report that they had come running out of a backyard. One subject claimed that they were searching for a lost iPhone and had been asking neighbors for assistance, stating that he "wasn't causing no trouble." Another individual, identified as Wendy, was identified as the operator of a vehicle. During the investigation, another officer identified a male present as a victim and asked him where he had been stabbed; the male indicated a wound on his side. Officers initially checked one subject, determining he had an active license and no active warrants.

During the course of the investigation, officers located the missing phone. I observed officers questioning the subjects about the location of "two black bags." One subject engaged in a discussion regarding his presence on the property, and an officer advised him that he had been captured on camera. When asked about items inside the vehicle, one subject admitted that the property was his. 

Another officer ordered the subjects to be placed in handcuffs, and they were detained. [INSERT: Name of Officer] read the subjects their Miranda warnings, advising them of their right to remain silent and their right to counsel. The subjects were asked if they understood the rights explained to them.

Following the Miranda advisement, I asked the subjects, "Does anybody want to take responsibility for the guns in the trunk?" One subject denied knowledge of the firearms, stating, "I didn't even know there was any fire."
