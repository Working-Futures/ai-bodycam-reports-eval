Narrative:
I was present during an incident involving a vehicle described as an "Uber ride." Observations were made regarding the vehicle's equipment, specifically a license plate cover referred to as a "toy cover" and window tint discussed as being "35%." I approached the male passenger, [INSERT: suspect name], and instructed him to "pop out" of the vehicle, advising him that I would explain the situation once he exited. The subject complied with the command to exit. I asked the subject if he had "nothing crazy" on him, to which he replied, "Nothing."

During the interaction, a firearm was discovered on the subject's person, and it was announced, "I got a fire on you." Immediate commands were issued to the subject to "Don't reach" and "Don't touch it." When asked if the weapon was loaded, the response was "No." I instructed that the subject be placed in handcuffs immediately. While securing the weapon, a concern was voiced regarding the chain mechanism to ensure the firearm did not discharge.

Following the securing of the subject, I remarked that the subject had been "shaking like a leaf" as soon as I walked up to him. The subject denied shaking due to nervousness, stating repeatedly that he just had "to take a piss." I requested a transport unit to the location of West Main and Morton and requested "firearm coverage." During the final exchange, the subject stated, "I'm not pulling away," and was advised to "chill out."
