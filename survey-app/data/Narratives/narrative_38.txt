Narrative:
I initiated a traffic stop on a vehicle [INSERT: vehicle description] after observing the operator put on his seatbelt. Upon making contact with the driver, I asked how he was doing. The driver asked why he had been pulled over and voluntarily stated, "I don't have my license." I confirmed with the driver that he did not have his license on his person. During the interaction, my partner observed that the driver had put his hoodie on, though noted he did not appear to move anything to the back of the vehicle. The driver expressed intent to record the interaction, and I advised him that we were recording as well.

I requested the driver's name and date of birth. The driver did not immediately provide this information, instead repeatedly arguing that he was pulled over for no reason while stopped at a red light. He denied having any weapons on his person. The driver became agitated regarding the use of my flashlight, demanding that I take the flash out of his face. I instructed the driver to stay where he was, then ordered him to "Come over here" and stated, "I don't want you near the car."

During a search of the vehicle, an officer located what was described as a "weird compartment." Following this discovery, I repeatedly asked the suspect for his name again. I then radioed the code "50K6" and requested a transport unit to the scene. The incident concluded with a statement regarding a "fighter on the cover" [INSERT: specific description of evidence seized due to unclear audio transcription].
