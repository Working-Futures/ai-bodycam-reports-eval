Narrative:

I engaged in a conversation with a male identified as Sean Blackwell near a brick building. Blackwell confirmed that he lived in building 62 and had lived there his entire life. I then directed my attention to a second male subject who was leaning on a vehicle and wearing plastic gloves. When asked why he was wearing the gloves, the subject stated, "I'm cold," and later reiterated, "I swear to God, I'm wearing lava gloves." I asked this subject if he lived around there, and he stated "No," indicating he lived on the street up at [INSERT: specific address]. I asked if he had any weapons on him, and he replied, "No." When asked for his age, he initially stated he was 16. Another male present at the scene identified himself as "Uzi."

During the encounter, I observed that the subject wearing gloves was standing in a bladed stance away from me. A search of the subject was conducted, during which an officer stated, "269, 269, 269," and indicated, "Right pocket, right pocket." The subject, identified as Rony Almanza, provided conflicting information regarding his age, stating at various points that he was 13, 16, and 19 years old. An assisting officer instructed the subject to cross his legs.

An officer asked the subject, "Do you demand the LTC?" referring to a License to Carry. I then advised the subject of his Miranda rights, stating he had the right to remain silent, that anything he said may be used against him in a court of law, that he had the right to consult with a lawyer before answering any questions and to have him or her present during questioning, and that if he could not afford a lawyer, one would be provided by the Commonwealth without cost. When asked, "Do you understand what I've told you?" the subject replied, "No." I then demanded the subject produce his license to carry.
