Narrative: At about 6:30 p.m. on Thursday, April 18, 2024, members of the Youth Violence Strike Force were on patrol in the area of 32 Forest Street when we observed a group congregating. We exited our cruiser to engage in conversation with the group. Upon our approach, I observed one individual, later identified as Sean Blackwell, blading his body away from us. I further observed a weighted object weighing down the right side of the individual's jacket. Based on these observations, we conducted a pat frisk of Blackwell and recovered a firearm from his right jacket pocket.

The recovered weapon was determined to be a Taurus firearm containing one round in the chamber and five rounds in the magazine. Blackwell, 18, of Roxbury, was placed under arrest and charged with unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition. During the incident, Blackwell stated that he lived at 62 Forest Street. We also identified and spoke with a 13-year-old male in the group identified as Rony Almanza, who was observed wearing plastic gloves which he claimed were because he was cold, and another individual identified as Uzi.

Following the arrest, an officer read the individual his Miranda rights. He was advised that he had the right to remain silent, that anything he said may be used against him in a court of law, that he had the right to consult with a lawyer before answering any questions and to have one present during questioning, and that if he could not afford a lawyer, one would be provided by the Commonwealth without cost. When asked if he understood these rights, the individual responded, "No." An officer then issued a demand for his license to carry.
