Narrative:
I responded to a call initiated by a panic alarm at 237 Bowdoin Street, located in front of the "cruise market." Upon arrival at the scene, I observed ballistics scattered all over the road. I immediately directed personnel to shut down traffic in front of the market and instructed officers to lock and secure the cruisers situated on "16 only." During the initial response, I spoke with an individual regarding an "extender" and repeated a command to "slow it down." A vest was located on the scene which was identified as belonging to an individual named Jose; I called out to Jose and verified that he was "good."

I subsequently ordered an individual to "sit up" multiple times and instructed them, "Don't talk." I questioned a party about the ownership of a radio and noted a statement regarding a mother who "removed that she just got out of a [INSERT: specific missing detail]." I observed that information regarding the incident seemed to be coming from "her daughter" and stated that I needed to speak to the daughter before proceeding. I identified myself as Unit 905 via radio and advised that I was making my way down to the "shell cages." I reiterated the necessity of keeping Bowdoin Street shut down to secure the area for officers at the original location.
