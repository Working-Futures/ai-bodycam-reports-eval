Narrative:
At about 8:20 p.m. on Friday, April 5, 2024, as a member of the Youth Violence Strike Force, I was on patrol in the area of 13 Woodville Street. I observed a motor vehicle operating at a high rate of speed. I immediately activated my cruiser's emergency lights and sirens to initiate a traffic stop. As the motor vehicle stopped, it quickly reversed at officers before stopping. Upon making contact with the occupants, I observed all the windows to have excessive tint. I requested the operator to exit the vehicle, which he refused. Officers made multiple requests for the operator to exit, and a struggle ensued.

During the struggle, officers felt what they knew to be a firearm in the suspect's waistband. Officers advised all other officers on scene of the presence of a firearm, and the suspect was placed into handcuffs. The firearm was later determined to be a Glock 19, with one round in the chamber and 14 rounds in the magazine. The suspect was identified as Nesli Bicenta, 28, of Norwood. The other occupant of the vehicle was promptly released from the scene. During the interaction, Bicenta told officers, “Y'all violating rights, bro,” and “Y'all violating me.” During the investigation, officers confirmed information regarding the vehicle and license status, verbally noting “Stolen” and “Suspended.”

I advised Bicenta of his Miranda rights, informing him of his right to consult with a lawyer, to have a lawyer present during questioning, and that one would be provided at no cost if he could not afford one. Following this, Bicenta stated, “I'm demanding your license to carry a firearm,” and remarked, “I'm going to take it, bro.” Bicenta was placed under arrest and charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, and unlawful possession of a large capacity feeding device. A transport unit was requested to the scene.
