Narrative: I, along with my partner, identified as Ralph, approached a vehicle at [INSERT: specific location near Woodville]. We ordered the suspect to step out of the vehicle and repeatedly commanded him not to move. I placed the suspect in handcuffs while he verbally claimed that we were violating his rights. I informed the suspect that we had the car based on our observations. Officer Ralph confirmed the vehicle status as stolen and suspended, mentioning "13 Woodville," and we visually verified the suspect's identity on the scene to confirm he was the correct individual.

During the detention, the suspect became agitated, and I repeatedly instructed him to relax. I then read the suspect his Miranda warnings, advising him that he had the right to consult with a lawyer before answering any questions, the right to have a lawyer with him during questioning, and that if he could not afford a lawyer and wanted one, a lawyer would be provided at no cost by the county. Following the advisement, the suspect stated, "No." He then demanded my license to carry a firearm and stated, "I'm going to take it, bro." Officer Ralph instructed the suspect to hold tight because a transport unit was en route, while the suspect continued to verbally insist that the incident was not handled properly.
