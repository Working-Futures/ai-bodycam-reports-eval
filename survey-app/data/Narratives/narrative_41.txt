Narrative:
I initiated a traffic stop at [INSERT: Location] and immediately ordered the driver (Suspect) to get out of the car. I repeated the command to "hop out" multiple times, but the Suspect refused to exit the vehicle. Instead, he stated he would provide his license and registration and explicitly stated he did not give permission for me to enter the vehicle. The Suspect repeatedly asked, "What am I doing?" and "Why are you pulling me out of my car?" while denying that he had hit anything. He insisted that I run his license first and claimed he had nothing in his hands. During the non-compliant exchange, the Suspect made statements regarding physical force, telling me, "You're gonna punch me in the fucking face," and "Hit me," before eventually saying "Take it" multiple times.

I advised the Suspect that he was under arrest. When the Suspect asked about the nature of the stop, I identified that he "wanted to stalk" unit 269. I demanded that the Suspect show me a license to carry a firearm. I observed a weapon in the vehicle and stated to the Suspect, "You got an illegal firearm under your seat." The Suspect responded by stating he did not want to run anyone over or "shoot back up." I further explained that he was pulled out of the vehicle because he failed to stop for the police for four blocks. I informed the Suspect that he was going to jail for the illegal firearm and failure to stop.
