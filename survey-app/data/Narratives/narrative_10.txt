Narrative: during the incident, I was engaged in a foot pursuit of a suspect, identified as [INSERT: suspect name]. During the pursuit, I shouted, "He touched the gun," observing that the individual was in possession of a firearm. I issued a command for the suspect to "Get the fuck down." I observed the suspect toss the gun. The suspect complied and was detained. While on the ground, the suspect repeatedly stated, "Call my B on the phone, please, bro."

I advised dispatch and responding units that we were located on Shafter Street, right off of Harbor. I informed an assisting officer, [INSERT: assisting officer name], that the suspect had tossed a firearm and directed them to the area where the weapon was thrown. An officer located the item and stated, "Yep, we have a firearm recovered."

I requested a transport unit to the scene. I coordinated with responding units to meet us at the location of Harvard at Waterloaf Street. I confirmed via radio that the firearm was recovered and the suspect was in custody. When asked by another officer if we were looking for anybody else, I confirmed, "No, just him."
