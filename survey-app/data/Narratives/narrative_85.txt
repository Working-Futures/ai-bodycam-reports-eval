Narrative:
At approximately 8:55 p.m. on Friday, February 23, 2024, I was on patrol with members of the Youth Violence Strike Force near Morton Street and Harvard Street. We observed a vehicle with heavily tinted windows speeding through the intersection. When we attempted to initiate a traffic stop, the vehicle swiftly made a U-turn and proceeded along Morton Street. We managed to successfully halt the vehicle and approached the driver and two passengers, including Tyrell Murphy, age 32 from Hyde Park, who was seated in the rear. Due to the heavy window tint, we requested the suspect lower his window. Upon observation, I noticed Murphy appeared visibly nervous and had a noticeable bulge in his hoodie pocket.

We ordered all passengers to exit the vehicle. During the encounter, I instructed an individual addressed as Mr. Fargo to step outside; he asked why and stated he did not understand the problem. Murphy resisted our commands, reaching towards his waist area and bending forward. I ordered him to get on the ground. Murphy stated, "I'm not reaching, bro," and asked if he was detained, to which I confirmed he was. Despite his resistance, we gained control of the suspect. During the struggle, officers discovered a firearm, announcing, "I got one." We recovered a loaded Smith & Wesson Bodyguard and a black ProMag extended magazine, which was later confirmed as stolen.

We commanded Murphy to lean forward and roll onto his side to fully secure him. A subsequent search of Murphy's belongings uncovered a Ziploc-style bag containing 38 pink pills, one green pill, and eight yellow pills suspected to be ecstasy with a Lego logo, along with three additional bags of marijuana. All items were seized as evidence. While securing him, I asked if he had anything else on his person, and we retrieved a red iPhone. Murphy was arrested and charged with unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, possession with intent to distribute Class B and Class D substances, and receiving stolen property. He was subsequently arraigned in Dorchester District Court.
