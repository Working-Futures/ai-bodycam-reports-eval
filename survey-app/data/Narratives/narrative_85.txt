Narrative:
I initiated contact with a vehicle and asked the occupants if they needed a back passenger. I ordered an individual identified as Mr. Fargo to step outside the vehicle. When Mr. Fargo asked why, I informed him it was because we were telling him to step outside. Mr. Fargo stated that he did not understand the "problem with cars." I then commanded Mr. Fargo to get on the ground immediately. Mr. Fargo stated, "I'm not reaching, bro," multiple times. I indicated that I had control of one of his limbs, stating, "I got one." Mr. Fargo asked if he was being detained, and I confirmed that he was. I repeatedly ordered Mr. Fargo to lean forward while I coordinated with [INSERT: assisting officer's name] to secure him. I stated, "I don't want this to go off," and instructed the other officer to "give him another first" before confirming we had Mr. Fargo secured.

Once Mr. Fargo was on the ground, I instructed him to roll onto his side and asked if he had anything else on his person. I asked the assisting officer if they had located an ID. I instructed the officer to "grab it up," referring to an item located on Mr. Fargo. I explained to Mr. Fargo that we were ensuring he had nothing else on him before standing him up, noting, "you had something on you, and you told us before." I instructed him to roll to his other side. I told Mr. Fargo that I would fix the handcuffs, but I admonished him that the struggle was over, stating, "So do not fight no more," and asked if he heard me. I advised him that I would not fix the restraints at that moment if he did not communicate with me.

I instructed Mr. Fargo to put his other hand behind his back and rolled him onto his side. I continued to search him, asking if he had anything under him, to which he replied, "No." Mr. Fargo mentioned a phone, which he identified as an iPhone with a red case. I told him I would grab the property and asked if he was "good with that," to which he replied, "Yes, sir." I then assisted Mr. Fargo to his feet. The audio transcript does not contain the specific probable cause for the initial contact, the specific nature of the item seized, or a reading of Miranda rights.
