Narrative:
I observed a male suspect wearing all black standing on the sidewalk. I exited my patrol vehicle and apprehended the subject. The suspect was secured in handcuffs. The suspect stated that he had been with another individual, referring to the person as "Cincinnati's guy." I communicated via radio that I was off with "Harry units."

I coordinated with another officer on the scene to switch the handcuffs on the suspect. While facilitating this exchange, I verbally warned the suspect that if he attempted to "get froggy" with me, he would end up on the ground. The suspect complied, and we discussed placing him into a cruiser for transport.

We investigated the scene to determine the suspect's path of travel relative to a nearby store. I observed a "commercial beanie" and a quantity of "smokes" on the ground. It was stated that the suspect "broke it in one of the stores." I indicated that I would return to the store to obtain materials to collect the evidence. The location of the store is [INSERT: specific store name/location].
