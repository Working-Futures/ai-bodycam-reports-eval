Narrative:
I initiated a traffic stop after observing a vehicle speeding, noting to the driver that they were "flying." Upon contact, the driver admitted, "I was flying," and voluntarily stated there was an open container in the back of the vehicle. I requested identification from the occupants. A passenger, later identified as Trevin Ramsey, became argumentative, asking why I was pulling them over and insisting they "didn't do nothing wrong." The driver attempted to de-escalate the situation, urging Ramsey to provide his ID. During the interaction, Ramsey threw a bottle out of the car, subsequently admitting, "I just put it out the car."

Officers on scene ordered the occupants to step out of the vehicle one at a time. During the extraction, an officer observed a firearm "poking out" of Ramsey’s left coat jacket pocket. I confirmed the handle was visible from the window. While securing the scene, another occupant, described as an "older guy," fled from the vehicle toward a field. Officers commanded everyone to stay where they were and handcuffed the remaining occupants, including Ramsey.

Upon searching Mr. Ramsey, who was identified as the front seat passenger, officers recovered a tan Polymer 80 handgun. The weapon was found to have one round in the chamber and six rounds in the magazine. The firearm was secured in a gun box. Mr. Ramsey was placed under arrest and charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of a loaded firearm, and unlawful possession of ammunition. He was subsequently arraigned in Dorchester District Court.
