Narrative: On Saturday, January 13, 2024, around 1:15 a.m., officers observed a vehicle traveling roughly 15 miles over the speed limit before taking an illegal turn. We conducted a traffic stop. Upon approaching the vehicle, we observed an open beer bottle in the back seat. Additionally, we clearly saw the handle of a firearm protruding out of the inside coat pocket of one of the passengers, later identified as Tevin Ramsey, 28, of Boston. I advised the occupants that the vehicle was speeding and noted the open container. The occupants argued that they had done nothing wrong and questioned why they were being pulled over. When asked for identification, the occupants were non-compliant and agitated.

During the interaction, an individual threw a bottle out of the car. We ordered the occupants to calm down, not to move, and to keep their hands where we could see them. We instructed them to exit the vehicle one at a time at the location of Greenwood and Harvard. During the intervention, an older male passenger fled the scene, running into a field. I observed the handle of the firearm, described as black and tan, poking out of Ramsey’s left coat pocket throughout the encounter.

Upon searching Mr. Ramsey, officers recovered a tan polymer 80 handgun with one round in the chamber and six rounds in the magazine. Mr. Ramsey was placed under arrest and charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of a loaded firearm, and unlawful possession of ammunition. He was subsequently arraigned in Dorchester District Court.
