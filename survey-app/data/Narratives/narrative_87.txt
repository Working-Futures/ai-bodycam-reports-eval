Narrative: On Sunday, March 3, 2024, at approximately 12:52 a.m., I, along with other officers from the Boston Police Anticrime Unit based in Roxbury, was on routine patrol in the area of Hampton Street and Melnea Cass. We observed an unregistered vehicle in violation of auto laws and initiated a traffic stop. The vehicle halted at the intersection of Albany and Hampton Street. Upon engaging with the operator, identified as Mario Thames, I asked for his driver's license. Thames initially claimed his license was at his house, but upon further questioning, he admitted he did not possess a valid license and had lied because he "didn't want to start doing that." I also observed that the license plate attached to the vehicle was not on file and was not real. Thames was subsequently ordered to exit the vehicle.

During an inventory search of the vehicle, officers noticed that the center console appeared tampered with and loose. A thorough examination revealed the handle and slide of a firearm. The weapon was identified as a loaded black and silver 9mm SCCY CPX1, with one bullet in the chamber and 11 rounds in the magazine. During the interaction, I asked Thames for his license to carry a firearm, and it was determined he did not have one. Thames later acknowledged the weapon, referring to it as a "grabber," and confirmed that there was "one up top" in the chamber, stating it was for safety precautions.

Thames was placed under arrest and I read him his Miranda rights from a card, including the right to remain silent and the right to counsel. Thames verbally confirmed he understood his rights by stating, "Yes, sir." He was cooperative, did not resist, and did not attempt to flee. We attempted to make a phone call to a contact Thames requested using his cell phone, but the call went to voicemail. Thames was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, possessing a high-capacity firearm, operating without a license, operating an unregistered vehicle, and a number plate violation to conceal identity. He was informed he was being transported to Nash Street and was subsequently arraigned in Roxbury District Court.
