Narrative:
I arrived at the incident location near the corner of Hampton and Albany Strait. I made contact with the driver of a vehicle, identified as Mario Ames [INSERT: date of birth], regarding a license plate that was not on file and determined to be not real. When I initially asked Ames about his driver’s license, he claimed it was at his house. Upon further questioning, Ames admitted he did not actually have a driver’s license and stated he was driving to his mother's house. I asked Ames if he had any weapons, needles, or illegal items on his person, and he initially replied, "No, sir."

During the interaction, commands were issued for Ames not to move. I asked Ames to provide a license to carry a firearm, and he admitted, "You don't have one?" implying he did not possess a license. A firearm was located, and when I asked if the gun was loaded, Ames confirmed, "Yes, yes, it is," and stated there was "one up top" in the chamber. Ames explained that having the round in the chamber was a "safety thing" to be precautious.

I advised Ames of his Miranda rights, informing him of his right to remain silent, that anything he said could be used against him in a court of law, his right to consult with a lawyer before answering questions, and his right to have a lawyer provided by the Commonwealth if he could not afford one. I asked Ames if he understood these rights, and he responded, "Yes, sir." I further explained that he could stop answering questions at any time.

Following the advisement of rights, Ames apologized for initially lying about his license. He requested to make a phone call to his child's mother. I attempted to dial the number provided by Ames using his phone, but the call was forwarded to voicemail. I informed Ames that he would be able to make a phone call after booking at the station. Ames remained cooperative throughout the encounter, did not fight, and did not attempt to flee. He was subsequently transported to [INSERT: specific police station or district, audio mentions B2/Nash].
