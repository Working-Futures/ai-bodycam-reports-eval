Narrative:
[INSERT: Date, Time, and Location of Incident] I was interacting with a subject who repeatedly asked, "What's my name?" The subject eventually answered his own question, identifying himself as Justin Palma, which I confirmed verbally. I explained to Palma that the first document I was processing was for his vehicle and his person, and I provided him with a copy of the paperwork.

I then proceeded to advise Palma of his Miranda rights. During the advisement, I initially misspoke, stating, "You have a right to disobey the law," before immediately apologizing and correcting myself. I then clearly stated, "You have a right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you in the court of law or the proceeding." Palma subsequently made several statements, including references to a flashlight and mentioning "Chelsea, Locke and Webster." He also made a vulgar remark regarding his person. Specifically, Palma stated, "I think I got a gun in my gun box." Following this statement, Palma began yelling, "Ma! Come here, Ma!" repeatedly. The interaction continued with Palma discussing a unit from "Chiltern Corp." The specific basis for the initial stop or the final disposition of the firearm mentioned is not further detailed in the provided audio [INSERT: basis for probable cause/arrest details and evidence seizure details].
