Narrative:
At about 3:38 p.m. on Friday, March 22, 2024, I, assisted by Boston Police officers assigned to the Area A7 and A1 Drug Control Unit, the Everett Police Drug Control Unit, and Chelsea Police, conducted a stop of Justin Palma, 21, of Everett. The stop occurred at Lock Street and Webster Court in Chelsea for the purpose of executing search warrants for Palma's body and his motor vehicle. At the time of the stop, Palma was operating the motor vehicle with a suspended license.

While executing the search warrant issued for his body, officers found Palma to be in possession of a loaded Smith & Wesson semi-automatic handgun. I provided Palma with a copy of the warrant, explaining to him that it was for his vehicle and for his person.

I subsequently administered Miranda warnings to Palma, advising him that he had the right to remain silent and that anything he said might be used against him in a court of law or proceeding. Following the administration of these warnings, Palma made statements regarding the firearm, remarking, "That's on my dick, too," and stating, "I think I got a gun in my gun box." Palma subsequently called out for "Ma" multiple times. [INSERT: details regarding transport, booking, and evidence logging]
