Narrative:
I responded to a report regarding a male subject who had made threatening statements about a device in the building. Upon arrival, I spoke with staff and security personnel. A witness described the suspect as a white male with dirty blonde hair, wearing a maroon long-sleeved shirt. I attempted to review security surveillance footage to identify the subject, but staff informed me the camera system was down and not recording. Investigation revealed the subject had used a credit card at the bar, but the name on the card did not match any registered guests, leading to suspicion that the card might be stolen.

We proceeded to check room 905. Upon locating a male matching the description inside the room, I asked him to step out to speak with us. The individual complied, and we placed him in handcuffs. I asked the subject if he had anything in the room that would be dangerous to officers or guests, specifically regarding a device. He stated, "Absolutely not." I informed him that we needed to discuss the conversation he held downstairs.

The suspect admitted to the interaction, stating that a dog was barking at him. He claimed he asked the handler, "Oh, you have a bomb-smelling dog?" and then stated, "I don't have any bombs or anything." He insisted he was just trying to calm the dog down and make a joke. I advised the suspect that making terroristic threats is a felony crime in Massachusetts and explained that his statements caused significant alarm, noting that the hotel almost went into lockdown.

We instructed the suspect to put on his shoes, which were black sneakers located by the bed. I asked about the location of his wallet, and he indicated it was in his bag or on the table. We located the wallet in the bag and secured it. The suspect was then escorted out of the building and placed into a police cruiser parked outside.
