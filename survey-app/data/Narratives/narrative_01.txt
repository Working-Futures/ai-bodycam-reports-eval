Narrative: I conducted a motor vehicle stop of a suspect, identified as [INSERT: suspect name], after observing a marked lane violation. During the stop, I determined that the vehicle’s registration was revoked and suspended due to a lack of insurance. I informed the suspect that the vehicle would be towed per department protocol and explained the process for him to retrieve it later from the station. I further advised the suspect that he would be required to appear in court to address the charge of operating a vehicle without proper registration.

In accordance with department policy, I began an inventory search of the vehicle prior to the tow to document its contents and protect against claims of lost or stolen property. I explained to the suspect that this inventory was a standard administrative procedure and not a search requiring his consent. During the course of this inventory, a firearm was located within the vehicle, specifically near the center console area. Upon discovering the weapon, I requested via radio that a supervisor and detectives respond to the scene, and I requested a Miranda warning card be brought to my location.

I read the suspect his Miranda warnings from a card, and the suspect confirmed that he understood his rights. I then made a formal demand for the suspect’s License to Carry (LTC) a firearm. The suspect stated that he did not have an LTC. Based on the presence of the firearm and the suspect's lack of a valid license to possess it, I placed the suspect under arrest. The suspect complied with my commands and did not resist or attempt to flee.

Due to the suspect’s physical limitations and his inability to walk, I assisted him in moving from the vehicle into his wheelchair. For the suspect's safety and comfort given his mobility needs, I secured him using "double cuffs" with his hands behind his back. I informed the suspect that the entire interaction was being recorded on my body-worn camera. The firearm was collected as evidence and [INSERT: method of storage or transport]. I remained on scene at [INSERT: exact location near Dorchester Street] to complete the vehicle inventory and await the arrival of the Patrol Supervisor and detectives.
