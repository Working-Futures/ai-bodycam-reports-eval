Narrative:
At [INSERT: time of incident], I initiated a traffic stop at 81 St. Andrews Road. The stop involved a vehicle with license plate 5 Romeo Sierra Kilo 89, which was identified as being linked to a shooting. During the stop, I ordered [INSERT: Name of Suspect] to stand up. Subsequently, a firearm was recovered and detected at the scene.

I requested that Detectives and PSL be called to the location. I interacted with a female present at the scene, advising her regarding individuals entering the area, and instructed a male subject to stand by. I requested a check on the address to determine when police were last dispatched to the location within the past two weeks. I also stated that we were going to get the door back to the station.

I requested a transport unit for the subject, noting that there was only one male individual involved. Unit Gold 101 confirmed they were en route to take the transport. I advised responding units, specifically Old 904, to continue in but to slow down, as there was no rush.
