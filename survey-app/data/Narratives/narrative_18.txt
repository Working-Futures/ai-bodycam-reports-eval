Narrative:
I instructed personnel to bring [INSERT: identity of individuals] over to the ambulance first for decontamination, to which an individual responded, "Yes sir." I directed the subject to stand up "real quick," stating, "It'll be on your property," and subsequently told him to have a seat. I observed the subject and noted, "he's doing something." I stated, "No," and asked, "How do you know?" I told the subject to "chill," advised him, "You don't want to put that on," and informed him, "I'm just gonna use your bag."

I asked the subject if his eyes hurt. He initially replied, "No, just my lungs," and stated, "I'm not burning." However, he immediately followed this by stating, "My eyes are burning." The subject was advised that "they don't want you to go back on the station." Regarding the incident, the subject stated, "The only thing that happened when I went through the door, it went through my lungs." He clarified his condition by adding, "But my eyes are good. I can see everything." I asked if his eyes or anything like that burned, specifically asking, "The mouth doesn't burn?" The subject replied, "No, the mouth is dry."
