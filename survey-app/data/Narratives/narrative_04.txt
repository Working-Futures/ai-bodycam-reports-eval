Narrative:
On [INSERT: Date and Time], at [INSERT: Location], I was interviewing a male suspect regarding a prior altercation. The suspect stated that another individual had been holding his bag. He explained that when he took the bag back, the other individual "rocked himself" and "broke his finger too somehow." The suspect insisted that the other individual hit himself and that he did not know how the finger was broken. I advised the suspect that providing false information post-arrest to a law enforcement officer is a felony and provided him multiple opportunities to answer truthfully regarding his identity.

The suspect identified himself as "Javier," spelling the name "J-H-A-B-I-A," and provided the last name "DeJesus." I challenged this information, noting a discrepancy with the name "De La Rosa," and informed him that I knew he was not telling the truth. I advised him that we would determine his identity at the station. As I placed the suspect in handcuffs, he asked why he was being restrained. I explained that if he did not provide identification, his real name would likely be found on his phone. The suspect acknowledged the phone was his but stated, "I'm not unlocking it for you," before asking me to "give me a good search."

The suspect continued to ask why he was under arrest. I indicated that we were "talking about her" and noted that "she's gonna be fighting." I instructed the suspect not to reach for anything and then ordered him to open the door and exit the vehicle. With the assistance of [INSERT: Name of Assisting Officer], I removed the suspect from the stop. As he was being removed, the suspect asked, "For what, Nicole?" and was subsequently taken into custody.
