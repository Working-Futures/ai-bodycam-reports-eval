Narrative:
On [INSERT: Date and Time of Incident], I was on patrol at [INSERT: Location of Incident] when I made contact with a male subject, identified as Robert Gomes. Mr. Gomes stated he had just come from work at North Coast. When asked for identification, Mr. Gomes stated he did not have it on his person. He provided a date of birth initially as June 11, 1922, before correcting himself to June 11, 1974. He stated he resides at 11 Tribble Street in Brockton. Upon running his information, I discovered an active warrant for suspended operation of a motor vehicle and unshipped motor vehicle operation out of the State Police.

I informed Mr. Gomes of the warrant. I instructed him to turn around and remove his backpack. When asked if he had any weapons, he initially stated he had a "double weapon" but then clarified that he did not. I placed Mr. Gomes in handcuffs. Throughout the interaction, Mr. Gomes argued regarding his identity, claiming he did not know his social security number because he had only been back in the country for a year. He asserted that he has a twin brother named Roberto Gomes who "drew drugs and steal all over Boston" and claimed I was confusing him with his brother.

During the detention, I questioned Mr. Gomes regarding the black backpack he was carrying. He stated that his cousin Michael had handed him the backpack on the corner while he was coming from work. I received information that [INSERT: Name/Title] Walzinski was reviewing surveillance cameras at that time. It was confirmed that the theft was captured on camera. I advised Mr. Gomes that he was under arrest for shoplifting sunglasses.

I conducted a search of Mr. Gomes's person and pockets incident to arrest. I advised him that I had searched the rear of my patrol vehicle prior to our arrival and that anything found there subsequently would be attributed to him. Mr. Gomes was taken into custody on the charge of shoplifting.
