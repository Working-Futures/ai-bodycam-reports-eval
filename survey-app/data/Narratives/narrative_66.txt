Narrative:
I was on scene interacting with a subject identified as Kyle. I repeatedly advised Kyle that he was "good." Kyle stated that a "big guy" had "manned up" on him and scared him, and he noted that the "last guy ran." Kyle also stated that his mother came and "ran down" on him. He requested that we tell his boss that he would not be going to work, and I acknowledged this request. Kyle subsequently asked, "Can you just pull my pants up, please?"

I asked the individuals present if they knew they had "crossed the town line" and noted they were supposed to be in Boston. Kyle confirmed he was from Boston. He expressed frustration that he was supposed to "drop off all this shit" by himself. Kyle asked for help and inquired, "What's the hourly rate?" adding, "I'll pay good." He further stated, "Let's go bang" and "Let's get my customers back." I responded, "No, we got him." Other officers on scene commented that Kyle was a "gentleman" and would be "all right."
