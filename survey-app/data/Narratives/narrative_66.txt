Narrative:
At about 8:20 p.m. on Saturday, April 27th, 2024, members of the fugitive unit executed an on-site warrant arrest of Kyle Francis, 29, of Roxbury in the area of 898 Belmont Street, Brockton. At the time of the arrest, Mr. Francis was wanted on outstanding warrants sought out of Roxbury District Court for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon and leaving the scene with personal injury.

Upon making contact, Mr. Francis was placed under arrest. During the interaction, he repeatedly stated, "Boss of police." I reassured him, stating, "You're good, Kyle," and explained that our approach was forceful because "the last guy ran." Mr. Francis stated, "He scared me," referring to "the big guy" who "manned up" on him, and mentioned that his mother "ran down" on him. Mr. Francis asked if we could tell his boss that he would not be going to work, to which we replied, "We got you, bro." He further requested, "Can you just pull my pants up, please?" [INSERT: specific details regarding physical restraint or searching].

Following the arrest, Mr. Francis and unidentified individuals at the scene discussed the location, noting we had "crossed the town line" and asking why we were out there when we were "supposed to be in Boston." Mr. Francis expressed concern about his work duties, asking, "What I'm supposed to do now?" regarding dropping off items. He attempted to negotiate assistance for his work tasks, asking about an "hourly rate" and stating, "I'll pay good." We confirmed custody of Mr. Francis, noting that he was "a gentleman" and "all right," before clearing the scene.
