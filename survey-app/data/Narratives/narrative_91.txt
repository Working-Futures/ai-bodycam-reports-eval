Narrative: On [INSERT: Date/Time], at [INSERT: Location], officers attempted to detain a suspect, later identified as Dupina. A struggle ensued as Dupina attempted to resist officers. During the altercation, I commanded the suspect to provide his hand and warned him of the use of force if he did not comply. Officers repeatedly instructed Dupina to "relax" and "let go." During the struggle, it was observed that the suspect was holding a plastic bag containing what appeared to be drugs. Officers were able to handcuff the suspect and recovered the plastic bag of suspected drugs from his hand.

After being secured, Dupina was placed under arrest. He stated, "I smoked," "I'm high," and "I'm an addict." I advised dispatch via Radio 4971 that drugs were recovered, the suspect was in custody, and requested a tow for the vehicle. During the interaction, Dupina alleged that I grabbed his genitals and repeatedly asked why he was being pulled over or arrested.

As officers conducted a motor vehicle inventory search, we recovered a pill bottle containing miscellaneous pills, as well as multiple rounds of live ammunition. Dupina was charged with unlawful possession of ammunition, possession to distribute Class B, possession with intent to distribute Class E, and resisting arrest. He was subsequently arraigned in Roxbury District Court.
