Narrative: I was involved in a struggle with [INSERT: suspect name] and told him, “I’m gonna punch you if you don’t give me your hand.” I ordered him to give me his hand multiple times. As the struggle continued, I told him to relax and let go, stating, “It’s over.” I asked if anyone had handcuffs and observed that there was already a handcuff on one of his hands. I continued to command him to release his hands and stop. During the interaction, I stated, “He has a bag of drugs on him.”

I contacted dispatch via radio (4971) and reported, “We have drugs recovered.” I advised that the individual was going to be in custody and requested a tow truck. I identified a pair of handcuffs at the scene as mine. I then addressed the suspect, showing him the recovered evidence and stating, “This was in your hand, buddy.” I informed him, “You’re under arrest.” The suspect responded, “Okay, that’s fine,” and admitted, “I smoked,” “I’m high,” and “I’m an addict.” I told him hopefully we would be able to get him some help for that.

Following the arrest, I asked the suspect, “Grab my fucking balls, huh?” and stated, “You grab my fucking nuts.” The suspect made comments about feeling “like a grown up.” The suspect then stated, “I ain't mad at shit,” but subsequently claimed, “I don’t know why the fuck I’m being pulled over,” and asked why he was being stopped. He asserted that there was nothing in the back of his wagon and nothing on him. The suspect repeatedly asked, "What am I being arrested for?"
