Narrative:
My partner and I arrived at [INSERT: specific location/address] and announced ourselves as "Boston Police." We made contact with an unidentified female individual inside the residence. I asked who else was in the house, to which she initially replied, "nobody." Upon further questioning regarding the location of the male subject and a child, she confirmed a four-year-old child was present. I informed her that we were looking for Kenneth. She confirmed that Kenneth stays at the residence and stated that "his baby" was also present. During this exchange, she stated, "Y'all just kicked on my wall."

We located the male subject, identified as Kenneth Wallace. During our interaction, Mr. Wallace asked, "Why are you in my pocket?" and questioned, "What am I being arrested for?" I informed Mr. Wallace that he was not under arrest at that moment but was being detained because we had a search warrant for him. Mr. Wallace asked what the search warrant was for, and I reiterated that the warrant was for him.

I advised Mr. Wallace of his rights, stating that he had the right to silence and the right to an attorney. When asked if he understood the rights, Mr. Wallace replied, "Yeah." Mr. Wallace asked if our body cameras were on, and I confirmed that they were. He then asked, "Do you have protection?" before stating, "I don't have protection." He requested the papers regarding the warrant, and I confirmed that I had them.

Kenneth Wallace was charged with unlawful possession of an assault weapon, unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, trafficking fentanyl 36 grams or more, and possession with intent to distribute a Class B substance.
