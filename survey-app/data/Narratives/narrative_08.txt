Narrative:
Officers responded to an incident regarding a report of an assault at [INSERT: Specific location of incident]. Information provided at the scene indicated that an individual had been brought in because he had been punched in the face and received "rib shots." The involved party was described as wearing a white tank top and a red shirt. It was noted that a male victim located inside the premises had sustained a concussion, and officers indicated that detectives would likely follow up on the investigation.

I made contact with a male subject at the scene who appeared to be intoxicated. When I initiated contact, the subject asked what was happening, and I reassured him that I was not going to shoot him. I asked the subject if anyone had obtained his name yet, and he replied in the negative. I then asked for his name, and he identified himself as Brian McDonnell. When I asked for his date of birth, McDonnell hesitated and did not provide the information [INSERT: Date of birth]. I attempted to ascertain a good address for him [INSERT: Subject's address]. During the interview, McDonnell commented on the altercation, stating, "He gave me a nice crack."

Following this statement, McDonnell became repetitive, stating "I didn't" multiple times. An ambulance was requested to respond to the "Jordan side" of the location. I informed McDonnell that we would "do the wagon" and instructed him that he was going to come with us. McDonnell complied with this instruction, responding, "Yeah." I advised him that we would get the situation figured out.
