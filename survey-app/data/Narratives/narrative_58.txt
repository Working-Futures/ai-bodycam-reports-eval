Narrative:
On [INSERT: Date and Time], I initiated a traffic stop on a vehicle in the vicinity of Washington and Erie. Upon making contact with the driver, identified as Mr. Porter, I advised him that the reason for the stop was that the “tents” were way too dark and that he had failed to come to a complete stop at a stop sign. I requested his license and registration. Mr. Porter identified the vehicle as a Renault. During the interaction, I observed that Mr. Porter appeared nervous, noting specifically that his chest was rising. I asked him if there was a reason he was trying to leave right away.

I instructed Mr. Porter to step out of the vehicle. He repeatedly questioned the command, asking, "Step out of what?" and "Why y'all stepping out the car for?" stating that he was stopped for a stop sign violation. I instructed him to unlock the door. I eventually opened the door from the inside. During the subsequent investigation, a firearm was recovered. I notified dispatch, stating, "Bravo 103, we got a firearm recovered," and requested that detectives respond to the location.

Following the recovery of the firearm, I and other officers on scene repeatedly asked Mr. Porter to provide his license to carry. Mr. Porter did not answer the question or produce a license, instead making comments such as "I love you, bro." An officer on scene then stated to Mr. Porter, "Listen, I'm going to read you your rights, okay?" The audio transcript concludes as the officer prepared to read the rights.
