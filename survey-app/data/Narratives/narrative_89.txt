Narrative:
I assisted officers in lifting an individual at the scene. I engaged with a male subject who stated, "Don't search me." I informed the subject, "I'm doing right now," and proceeded with the search. The subject stated, "Let me walk in here," and repeatedly engaged in a statement that "They came from New York City." I attempted to ascertain the subject's language, asking, "Oh, so French?" and subsequently requested via radio if a French-speaking officer was available for translation. I advised the subject that I would put him in the report.

During the investigation, the subject mentioned experiencing a "gentle high." I consulted with an assisting officer regarding the transport of the individuals detained. I asked, "You want them all in the wagon?" and the officer responded affirmatively. I stated that "We got buys off all three of them," indicating the basis for the arrest was a narcotics transaction involving the three subjects.

Following the securing of the subjects, I observed a Blue Honda Fit occupied by a male driver and a female passenger near Lincoln and Market. I transmitted a description of the vehicle with the license plate One X-Ray Alpha Kilo 4-4 regarding erratic operation on Market Street. I then confirmed with assisting units that they would follow us back to [INSERT: destination].
