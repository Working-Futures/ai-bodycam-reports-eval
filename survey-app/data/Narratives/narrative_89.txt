Narrative:
At about 3:43 p.m. on Wednesday, April 24, 2024, members of the Drug Control Unit of District D-14, Allston-Brighton, conducted an investigation in the area of 21 Farrington Street. Following this investigation, which included the observation that we “got buys off all three of them,” we arrested Amadou Sow, 31, of Bronx, New York; Amity Dioum, 24, of New York City; Ibra Sow, 29, of New York City; and Dioum Chekunah, 21, of New York City. During the interaction, a subject stated, "Don't search me," to which I responded, "I'm doing right now." Due to a language barrier, a request was made for a French-speaking officer for translation.

Boston police officers recovered 83 Apple AirPods Pro, 7 Apple AirPods Max, and 3 Apple Watches Ultra 2s, totaling approximately $12,000 in stolen Apple products. Officers also recovered approximately $704 in U.S. currency. [INSERT: specific location where items were recovered from each suspect].

All four suspects were placed under arrest and charged with receiving stolen property over $1,200. Ibra Sow was additionally charged with furnishing false identification to a police officer. Dioum and Chekunah were charged with resisting arrest. During the arrest process, officers had to coordinate physical efforts to lift a subject, counting "One, two, three, up," before placing the individuals in the wagon. All suspects were arraigned in Brighton District Court.
