Narrative:
I engaged with a male individual [INSERT: Victim Name] who stated that a suspect "went up the dog" and was crossing the street. The victim provided a description of the suspect as an older male with gray hair, a slim build approximately 5'6" or 5'7", wearing glasses that had fallen down, and dressed in gray bluish jeans. I told the staff I would work with them momentarily and radioed as Delta 631 that I had a problem in the area.

The victim then informed me, "It looks like he stabbed me in the leg." I asked the victim to give me the description again, and he described the suspect as wearing light blue jeans and plaid blue. The victim then visually identified a subject, stating, "That's the guy that stabbed me," and indicated the suspect was coming towards him right in front of the firehouse.

I approached the identified subject [INSERT: Suspect Name] and ordered him to put his hands behind his back. I stated that I was putting the subject in a car. Another officer or I stated, "I'll take him" and directed the subject to get in the car. The provided audio does not explicitly record the administration of Miranda warnings, specific search procedures, or whether the subject offered verbal or physical resistance beyond the initial command.
