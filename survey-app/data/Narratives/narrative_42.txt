Narrative:
I responded to a call regarding an individual attempting to gain entry to a residence at 230 Harrison Ave, Apartment 420. Dispatch advised that the subject was reportedly using power tools. Upon arrival, I made contact with a male suspect in the hallway, later identified as John [INSERT: Last Name]. I observed that the suspect appeared to be sweating. When asked about his presence, John stated he was changing the lock for a friend, identified as Dan Mowry, because Mowry had broken his key in the door and maintenance personnel were unavailable. John further stated that Mowry was currently in Providence, Rhode Island. John acknowledged that a bag located at the scene belonged to him.

I informed John that the circumstances indicated a Breaking and Entering (B&E) investigation. I attempted to verify his account by asking him to contact the resident, but John became defensive and argumentative. Due to his non-compliance, I ordered John to place his hands behind his back and advised him he was being detained. John refused to comply with my commands.

A physical struggle ensued as I attempted to effect the arrest. During the altercation, John alleged that he had a broken rotator cuff and complained of shoulder pain. John kicked at me, striking my cigarette. I advised John he was under arrest for Attempted Assault and Battery (A&B). The suspect eventually stated "we're cool" and was secured. Following the arrest, radio traffic indicated other units were pursuing a second subject.
