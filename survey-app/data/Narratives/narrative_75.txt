Narrative:
I advised the suspect that he was under arrest and ordered him to put his hands behind his back. The suspect, later identified as Christopher Jollymore, was told to stop fighting. Although Jollymore repeatedly stated, "I'm not resisting," I observed that he was resisting and informed him of this fact. Despite commands to "Don't move," Jollymore attempted to stand up multiple times. Officers on the scene confirmed that two suspects were in custody while one remained outstanding.

I questioned Jollymore regarding why he was running. He denied running, stating, "I stopped when you told me to stop." I advised him that he had been running. Officers confirmed the suspects matched the description of individuals in dark clothing, one possessing a backpack and one with a silver moped. A scooter was located at the scene. Officers explained to Jollymore that we received a call that someone was stealing a bike and that the suspects took off, which required officers to tackle the subject. Jollymore identified a backpack at the scene as his own. Officers identified a bike present at the scene as the property the suspects were trying to steal.

During the detention, Jollymore complained of discomfort, specifically regarding his left wrist, and requested the handcuffs be loosened. An officer checked the restraints, advising Jollymore that he could fit his finger through the handcuffs and that they were not too tight. Jollymore also mentioned his "left one's bad," referring to his foot or leg. He was advised he would be placed in a wagon for transport.

When asked for his identification, the suspect provided the name Christopher Jollymore and stated he did not have warrants. I asked him, "What's in here?" regarding items in his possession, and he identified them as his keys. [INSERT: whether Miranda rights were read] is not present in the audio recording. The interaction concluded with preparations for transport.
