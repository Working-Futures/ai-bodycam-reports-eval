Narrative:
I arrived on the scene and made contact with a male subject. I observed that the subject did not attempt to hide an object when I pulled up, noting that he should have tried to hide it out of respect. I asked the subject what was on his back, and he replied it was a "personal bag," though he added, "Maybe," and "I don't know." I asked the subject for his name [INSERT: Suspect Name] and his birthday [INSERT: Suspect DOB]. I asked if he had any warrants, and he replied, "No, I don't have any warrants." I further inquired why he had a car and asked for his mother's name [INSERT: Mother's Name].

I informed the subject that I was not placing him under arrest but stated, "I just gotta check you for more drugs." I asked if he had anything on him, specifically inquiring about needles that might pump me. I directed the subject to step aside for a minute. During the pat-down, I asked, "What's this here?" and the subject expressed frustration. I asked if he had been cooperating, and he confirmed he was. The subject then stated, "I got a knife." I told him to relax and asked, "You got a knife on you?" The subject replied, "No, sir," and denied having any weapons when asked again.

I questioned the subject about a bulge, asking, "What's that?" The subject replied, "My dick, man." I stated to the subject that a bag was concealed in that area. The subject initially denied this, stating, "I don't have a bag in my dick." However, shortly after, the subject admitted, "Damn, it's in my dick, cuz." He requested that I "hold up" and claimed, "I just found that bag." I indicated that he did not need to show me the item as I recovered it. Following this, I lit a cigarette for the subject.

I requested the subject give us his phone. I checked the subject's waistband, clarifying that I was not going for his crotch. I then advised the subject that before asking any questions, he must understand his rights. I read the warnings from the transcript which stated, "You have the right to make a sign," and "If you choose to speak, anything you say may be used against you in the court of law."
