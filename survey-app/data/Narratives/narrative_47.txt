Narrative:
I asked the subject, [INSERT: Suspect Name], if they understood, to which the subject replied, "I don't care about that." The subject immediately began screaming that their neck was broken. The subject made references to "Alphabets" and a monetary amount before I stated, "I'll go in there." The subject yelled the names "Shannon or Melvie." The subject then stated, "Possession of meth," and claimed, "They took my pipe," while noting, "They didn't even arrest me." The subject accused officers of searching them illegally.

The subject shouted, "Hey, I gotta stop," and proceeded to yell "Stop" repeatedly while continuing to claim their neck was broken. I ordered the subject to "Get up." The subject responded, "Yes, I do," and made a statement regarding "Randolph Police on deadly force." The subject alleged that an MRI had been done on their neck and that their shoulder was dislocated because of the incident. The subject stated, "Pick me up and tell them to drop me off." The subject reiterated that they had "possession of meth" but had not been arrested, and again claimed the search was illegal. I ordered the subject, "On your feet."
