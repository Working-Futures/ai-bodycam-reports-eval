Narrative:

I engaged with the subject at [INSERT: location/scene], instructing him multiple times to remove his hands from his pockets. The subject eventually complied, stating he was not a criminal. I asked the subject if he possessed anything sharp or dangerous, to which he replied, "No." I then ordered the subject to separate his feet and remain still while I conducted a search. During this interaction, the subject mentioned that he uses his keys and items for his work with the "Capones family" in the north. When asked specifically about a knife, the subject initially claimed that a sergeant had already taken it from him.

Following this, another officer requested to search the subject "real quick," and the search was concluded. The subject questioned why we were there and asked what he was being accused of, stating that he did not know an individual named "Achoki" and did not know anyone involved. He requested to be registered and offered to get his wife. When asked if he had any money, the subject confirmed he had "no money" and "no dinero."

I asked the subject why he had the knife in his possession. I subsequently instructed him to put the item back in his pocket and keep it in his bag. The subject repeatedly stated that he had "not one problem" and "no problem" with us. Another officer indicated that the subject was "going in the cruiser." A discussion ensued regarding which officer should conduct a final check of the subject before transport. Upon inspecting the knife found on the subject, I noted that it was his property and determined that the blade was "less than two and a half" inches and "legal."
