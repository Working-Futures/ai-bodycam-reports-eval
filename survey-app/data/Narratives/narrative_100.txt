Narrative:
On Tuesday, March 7, 2023, around 2:10 p.m., I responded with other officers from Boston's B-2 District to a report of a person stabbed in the area of 189 Blue Hill Avenue. Upon arrival, we immediately began to render aid to a victim suffering from a laceration to the neck. As backup arrived, a second victim was located, also suffering from a laceration to the neck. The suspect had fled the scene on foot prior to our arrival. I spoke with a witness, the sister of one victim, who stated she was in her car when the suspect approached and stabbed the victim who was standing nearby. I also interviewed a witness identified as Isaiah [INSERT: Last Name], who observed the suspect running from the scene and briefly followed him. Based on witness statements, we broadcast a description of the suspect as a light-skinned Hispanic male wearing a black hoodie and gray sweatshirt.

While checking the surrounding area, officers spotted a male matching the suspect's description. After a brief foot chase, officers were able to apprehend the suspect, later identified as Ruben Liska, 21, of Dorchester. I facilitated a show-up identification with a witness. Prior to the identification, the witness was provided with instructions in both English and Spanish, stating that the individual being shown might or might not be the perpetrator and that the investigation would continue regardless of the result. The witness positively identified Liska as the suspect.

One of the victims was transported to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, while the other victim was released at the scene. Officers canvassed the area for video surveillance and [INSERT: details regarding the collection of the dangerous weapon].
