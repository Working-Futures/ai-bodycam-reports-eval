Narrative:
I responded to a report of a confirmed stabbing in the area of [INSERT: specific street address, likely 49 Howard]. Upon arrival, a female victim was located holding her neck and asking for help. A witness, identified as Maria, stated that she recognized the suspect as her father's cousin and that he had fled the scene immediately after the incident. Two additional witnesses, including a male identified as Isaiah, observed the female victim in distress and chased the suspect on foot. They described the suspect as a male looking back and forth, wearing a gray puffy coat or sweatshirt. The female victim was transported to Boston Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries, while a second victim was released at the scene.

Officers, including a K-9 unit, established a perimeter and canvassed the area for a suspect described as a light-skinned Hispanic male wearing a black hoodie, gray sweatshirt, and black facemask. An officer reported nearly striking a male matching this description with his cruiser as the subject sprinted across [INSERT: street name, likely Blue Hill Ave]. Officers spotted the male matching the suspect's description, and after a brief foot chase, they were able to apprehend him.

A show-up identification procedure was conducted with the witness Maria. An officer provided her with show-up instructions in Spanish, advising her that the person she would see might be among the people shown, that it was important to identify him only if she was sure, and that the investigation would continue regardless of her identification. Maria positively identified the detained subject as the perpetrator.

The suspect was identified as Ruben Liska, 21, of Dorchester. Liska was placed under arrest and charged with two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and resisting arrest. He was subsequently arraigned in Roxbury District Court.
