Narrative:
I arrived at the location identified as Washington Beach. I ordered an individual to remove his bag and place his hands behind his back, effectively placing him into custody. I asked the subject if he had anything on him, specifically inquiring about knives or sharp objects to ensure safety during the search. The subject replied that he did not think so, and he was informed that he was under arrest. Another subject on the scene, identified as Matt, stated he was 27 years old and informed us that he was in possession of a crossbow. Officers on the scene confirmed the detention of multiple individuals, noting that cuffs were on several subjects.

During the investigation, an officer identified a "white kid" with a camera as the individual who had done "two spray paints" and took a picture of it. I informed the subjects that they were being detained regarding tagging property. I further stated that I had probable cause because they were "walking down the street drinking alcohol." When the subjects demanded to know specific details about the property in question, I advised them that we were not going to debate the matter on the street and that it would be addressed back at the station.

I advised the subjects of their Miranda rights, specifically stating, "You have the right to remain silent," and asking if they understood that no one wanted them to incriminate themselves. Following this, I collected identification information from the group. One individual identified himself as "Twin" with the last name "Alex," another identified himself as "Richard," and a third identified himself as "NOLA."

We proceeded to collect evidence and personal property, including a blue bag and a phone. I advised the subjects that items such as weapons, phones, wallets, and keys would be placed in property bags and kept separate from them during transport. One subject requested "lamb over rice" with white sauce from Halal Guys. I confirmed that all property would be transported back to the station. The subjects were secured for transport, and I verified that the cruiser was locked.
