Narrative:
At about 6:03 p.m. on Wednesday, March 20, 2024, officers assigned to District A1, downtown, responded to the area of Washington Street and Winter Street for a report of a vandalism in progress. We were advised that five suspects were seen spray painting a box truck and multiple buildings. We were provided a description of the suspects and observed them walking down Washington Street towards Neyland Street. As officers approached the group, one suspect began to run, and a foot pursuit ensued. Officers were quickly able to stop the suspect and place him into handcuffs. The other four suspects were arrested without incident. The individuals were identified as Dion Weatherspoon Crosby, 31, of Roxbury; Richard Hortus, 27, of Roxbury; Nolan Smith, 19, of Marshfield; Matthew Hauser, 27, of Boston; and Alexander Quinones, 25, of Dorchester.

During the interaction, I instructed a suspect to take his bag off and place his hands behind his back. I asked if he had anything on him, specifically inquiring about knives or sharp objects to ensure officer safety. The suspect stated he did not think so. I explicitly advised the individual, "You're under arrest." We coordinated transport, confirming unit 699 was on scene. During the identification process, one suspect identified himself as "Matt," age 27, another identified as "Twin" with the last name "Alex," and a third confirmed his name was "Richard." An officer on scene identified one of the detained individuals as the specific suspect who completed "two spray paints" and noted that a picture had been taken of him. Another suspect described as a "white kid" was identified as having a camera and videotaping the incident.

When the suspects questioned why they were being detained and asked for details, I informed them they were under arrest for tagging property. I explained that probable cause was already established and noted they were observed walking down the street drinking alcohol. I verbally provided Miranda warnings, stating, "You have the right to remain silent," and asked if they understood, advising them that no one wanted them to incriminate themselves.

We secured the suspects' property, including phones, wallets, keys, and a blue bag, ensuring to check for weapons or contraband. I advised the suspects to remain still during transport. All five suspects were placed under arrest, charged with defacement of property, and subsequently arraigned in Boston Municipal Court.
