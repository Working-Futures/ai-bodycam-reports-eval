Narrative:
On [INSERT: Date] at approximately [INSERT: Time], I initiated a traffic stop on a vehicle at [INSERT: Location]. The basis for the stop was a driver's side brake light that was out ("flat out"). Upon making contact with the operator, identified as [INSERT: Suspect Name], I requested his registration and proof of insurance. The driver stated he did not have physical proof of insurance on him but that it was accessible "in the app." I instructed him to pull up the proof of insurance to show to my partners. When I informed the driver regarding the brake light defect, he stated he was unaware of the issue.

Subsequently, I instructed the driver to exit the vehicle. I asked him if he had anything "crazy" on his person, which he denied. I advised him that he could step out of the vehicle voluntarily, or I would remove him. Upon his exit, I conducted a pat-down search to ensure he possessed no objects that could "stick" or "poke" officers. I explained to the driver that I observed him pulling his hood up as soon as I positioned my vehicle behind him and noted that he appeared nervous with his heart beating rapidly. The driver disputed this account, stating his hood was already on and that he was actually attempting to fasten his seatbelt when I observed him.

Following the pat-down, I conducted a search of the vehicle. The driver questioned the necessity of the search, and I reiterated that his behavior regarding the hood and his visible nervousness provided the reason for the investigation. The search of the vehicle yielded negative results, with no contraband or individuals of interest found. Another officer on scene indicated that a records check of the individual showed "nothing." I informed the driver that based on the results of the investigation, we would not be arresting him, but I would instead issue a civil citation for the infraction.
