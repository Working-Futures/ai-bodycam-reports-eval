Narrative:
I engaged with a female subject, [INSERT: Subject Name], who provided an account of a physical altercation. The subject stated that a male individual ran up behind her and put his hands on her, causing her to fall straight to the floor. She explained that she turned around to defend herself because she did not know who the individual was. She alleged that the man punched and grabbed both her and her daughter, [INSERT: Daughter's Name]. The subject admitted to throwing her drink in the man's face, stating she took this action because he hit her and because she knew who he was. She further complained that the individual failed to announce himself as an officer before making physical contact and "tussling" with her.

The subject pointed out a female witness nearby who allegedly possessed video footage of the incident and mentioned a male witness on the video who told the other male to stop touching them. She requested to walk over to the female witness to obtain her information and demanded the name of the male involved, expressing her intent to press charges against him. The subject also noted that her vehicle was parked at the location and needed to be moved. When I attempted to guide the subject toward [INSERT: specific location/vehicle], she initially refused to walk, stating she would not go unless she was being put in a "paddy wagon." I confirmed, "That's where we're going." The subject complied, acknowledged with "Alright," asked about the status of her car, and instructed an individual to "Hold that."
