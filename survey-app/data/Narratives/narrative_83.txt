Narrative:
On Thursday, March 21, 2024, at approximately 9:54 a.m., I was working a paid detail at 36 District Avenue. I observed Amari Robinson, 30, of Roxbury, and April Payne, 52, of Dorchester, exhibiting aggressive behavior towards store staff and vandalizing store property. Additionally, Robinson committed larceny from a building by stealing cash from a tip jar. When I intervened to stop their behavior, the suspects turned their aggression towards me. They assaulted me, striking me multiple times. During the physical altercation, Robinson escalated the violence by throwing a cup of coffee at my face.

Additional units rushed to the scene, and the suspects were promptly taken into custody. While being detained, Robinson argued that I ran up on her from behind and "tussled" her without announcing myself as an officer. She admitted to the assault, stating, "that's why I threw my drink in your face because I knew who the fuck you were." Robinson mentioned that a woman in line had a video of the encounter and requested to obtain that information. She initially refused to walk to the transport vehicle, stating, "I'm not walking over there," but complied once I confirmed we were going to the wagon. She also noted that her car was parked at the location.

Following the incident, I received medical attention from EMS and was subsequently transported to a local hospital for further treatment. Both suspects were formally charged with malicious destruction of property and assault and battery on a police officer. Robinson faces an additional charge of larceny from a building.
