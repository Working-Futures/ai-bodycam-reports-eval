Narrative:
I responded to a call regarding three males trespassing and kicking on a door at [INSERT: incident location]. Upon arrival, I encountered three male subjects in the hallway. When I asked the subjects for identification, they initially stated they had no IDs. I advised them that they were being investigated for trespassing and were required to identify themselves. The subjects denied kicking any doors and claimed they were there to visit family, specifically a cousin or mother, for "Christmas." I explained that I had received a call about individuals banging on doors and needed to verify their reason for being in the building.

During the investigation, a female identified as a relative of the subjects arrived on the scene. When questioned, she admitted that she did not live at the location. Based on the fact that the alleged host did not reside there, probable cause was established that the three male subjects were trespassing. I requested additional units to the scene. We proceeded to identify the subjects; one identified himself as Dajon Harrison, another as Tyler White, and the third as Donnie Henderson.

I advised the subjects that they were being detained. I read them their Miranda rights, explaining that they had the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. When I asked Mr. Henderson if he understood what I told him, he replied, "Yes, sir." During the subsequent investigation and search incident to arrest, officers recovered a firearm. Mr. Henderson was found to be in possession of a loaded Ruger LCP .380 equipped with an extended magazine containing seven rounds.

Mr. Henderson was taken into custody and charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of a large capacity feeding device, unlawful possession of ammunition, and trespassing. The firearm was secured as evidence. The investigation determined that the subjects did not reside in the building and the individual they claimed to be visiting did not reside there either.
