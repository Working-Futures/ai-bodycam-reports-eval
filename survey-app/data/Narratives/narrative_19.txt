Narrative:
I was involved in an incident at a location identified as "Lullaby American Legion." I made contact with a male subject and engaged in questioning regarding his purpose in the area. I asked the subject if he had his son and where he was picking him up, observing, "You don't live in the street where you're picking up your son." I remarked to the subject that "this is a problem" and was "weird." The subject stated, "I don't know how to get here," and "I don't know the name of this place." When asked if he grew up in Boston, the subject responded, "I grew up here."

I asked the subject if he had any weapons "in the barrel," to which he replied, "Nothing." I instructed the subject, "You should get the vehicle for me," and informed him that he would have to "step out real quick" so I could "make sure there are no weapons." During this interaction, I asked if there was "nothing in the car" or "anything in the car," and the subject confirmed, "Nothing in the car."

I conversed with [INSERT: other officer identified in audio] regarding the status of the detention, stating, "Nobody was in cuffs or anything yet," and noting that I "didn't want to say it out loud." I confirmed via radio that "we have a traffic stop" involving a man at the American Legion location. I advised dispatch, "You can call it, I think, 8-0." [INSERT: basis for probable cause, citation, or arrest details].
