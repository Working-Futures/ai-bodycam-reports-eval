Narrative:
On [INSERT: Date/Time], I was present at the Maverick projects when I observed a group of individuals. I asked them, "Why y'all moving like that?" and "What's up?" As I walked up on the male suspect, he started walking away, which caused me to question his behavior. I initiated a foot pursuit, broadcasting "101 foot chase." The pursuit led to a location on London Street. Upon locating the suspect in a backyard, I issued verbal commands telling him, "Don't fucking move."

I made physical contact with the suspect, stating, "I feel him," and repeatedly instructed assisting officers to "Cuff him." The suspect was successfully placed in handcuffs and detained behind the building. I advised other units that we had the suspect in custody. During the encounter, I located a firearm in the immediate vicinity, announcing, "I got the firearm right here." I identified the weapon as a Glock, and another officer on scene confirmed that it looked like a Glock. I asked the suspect, "You got a gun?"

Following the detention, I instructed officers to "Search him again." I repeatedly demanded to see the suspect's license to carry, asking, "Where's your license to carry?" and "You don't have one?" I subsequently instructed the assisting officers to retrieve a Miranda card from the patrol vehicle and to read the suspect his Miranda rights.
