Narrative:
On Thursday, March 21, 2024, at approximately 10:21 a.m., officers assigned to District B-2, Roxbury, responded to the Burger King located at 100 Washington Street in Dorchester regarding reports of an individual wielding a knife. Upon arrival, I interviewed the victim, who stated that while waiting to place an order inside the store, she witnessed an employee, later identified as Pedro Carbuccia, displaying disrespectful behavior towards an elderly customer. The victim stated she intervened to advise the suspect to show respect, which resulted in a verbal altercation during which Carbuccia used profanity toward her. The victim and a witness, her husband, reported that Carbuccia emerged from behind the counter brandishing a knife and challenged the victim to a physical altercation. The witness described the weapon as a "little head knife."

I entered the store to investigate and located Carbuccia. I informed him that I was going to pat him down. During the interaction, I inquired about a knife located [INSERT: specific location of knife discovery], to which Carbuccia admitted ownership, stating, "This is mine." I spoke with another employee, Miguel, who confirmed Carbuccia’s identity but stated he was in the office doing paperwork and did not witness the specific conflict. I reviewed security camera footage with staff to attempt to corroborate the timeline of events described by the victim regarding when Carbuccia was at the counter and when he approached the doorway.

Based on the allegations and witness statements, I determined probable cause existed for an arrest. I informed Carbuccia that due to the allegations and witnesses involved, we had to take him with us. Carbuccia complied with my instructions to put on his jacket and place his hands behind his back. I placed Carbuccia into handcuffs without resistance or further incident. I advised him that he was being taken in for fingerprints and then to court. Carbuccia was arrested and charged with assault with a dangerous weapon.
