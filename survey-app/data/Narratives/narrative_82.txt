Narrative:
I arrived at the scene and made contact with a female victim who appeared visibly distressed. She stated that she was attempting to eat breakfast with her husband when an employee, later identified as Pedro, began making disparaging remarks about an older female customer. When the victim confronted Pedro, stating his behavior was not nice, she reported that he directed profanity at her. She alleged that Pedro then came from around the counter to the doorway, brandishing a small knife described as a "flicker" or "head knife," and threatened to beat her. Her husband confirmed he also saw the knife. I entered the establishment and spoke with Pedro, who admitted to the verbal altercation regarding the customers but initially denied threatening anyone with a knife or leaving the building. I also interviewed a witness employee, Miguel, who stated he was in the office during the dispute but observed Pedro walking toward the door while the customer was yelling.

I proceeded to review the store's security footage with Miguel and my partner. The victim verified Pedro’s identity on the video monitor. The footage showed Pedro at the counter and walking toward the door, though the victims indicated the specific threat occurred prior to the moment Pedro received his food in the video timeline. I asked Pedro if he had identification and conducted a pat-down search. During the investigation, a knife was discovered [INSERT: specific location where knife was found]. When questioned about the weapon, Pedro admitted, "No, this is mine," and claimed he used it for his work crew.

Based on the witness statements alleging the brandishing of a weapon and the discovery of the knife, I determined there was probable cause for arrest. I informed Pedro that due to the allegations and witnesses involved, we were taking him into custody. I inquired if he had a jacket, and after he identified his belongings, I instructed him to place his hands behind his back. Pedro complied with my commands and did not resist. I informed him that he would be transported for fingerprints and to court. No Miranda warnings were audible in the provided transcript.
