Narrative:
I responded to the vicinity of 157 Wash regarding a report of an armed robbery. I made contact with a male subject and advised him that a reporting person stated someone at the location wearing a red shirt and gray pants had robbed a victim with a gun. The subject repeatedly replied, "I didn't know that." I instructed the subject to sit down, and he complied. I spoke with the victim, [INSERT: Victim Name], who stated that while they initially did not see the suspect's face, they observed a male standing nearby wearing a red hat and gray sweatpants. The victim described the suspect looking into their eyes and looking all around. The victim provided the sequence "242-050-147" and mentioned the name "Carmel." When viewed, the victim positively identified the detained subject, stating, "Yeah, that's him, yeah."

I instructed the suspect, [INSERT: Suspect Name], to stand up. He complied with my commands. The suspect expressed a need to secure his uncle's phone number. I facilitated the recording of a number, providing 857-230-9015 during the exchange. I informed the suspect that he was arrested because of what happened and his presence at the scene. I inquired about the contents of the suspect's wallet and asked if he wished for an individual on scene to take his lighter, advising him that he could not have it at the booking station and it would be disposed of otherwise. During the interaction, the name "Carlos" and "Apartment 2" were mentioned regarding the transfer of property. The location of the incident was identified as being in front of the Dolby.
