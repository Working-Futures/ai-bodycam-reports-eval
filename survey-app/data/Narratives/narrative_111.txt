Narrative:
I responded to the area of Harvard and Walsh regarding an original call for an assault with a firearm. Upon arrival, Officer Pat Friston made contact with a male subject, later identified as Santiago Webb. Officer Friston asked Webb to take his hands out of his pockets. Webb stated his hands were out, but Officer Friston observed otherwise and noted that Webb started walking away. Officer Friston ordered Webb to be handcuffed, and a firearm was recovered from Webb’s front waistband. Officer Friston requested detectives to the scene.

Officer Friston asked Webb if he possessed a License to Carry (LTC), and Webb confirmed that he did not. Officer Friston then read Webb his Miranda rights from a card, informing him of his right to remain silent and his right to consult with a lawyer. When asked if he understood, Webb responded, "Okay." Webb stated he did not have physical identification but verbally identified himself as Santiago Webb. [INSERT: Date of Birth] was provided. Webb made spontaneous statements regarding his jingling keys and stated, "the fucking holiday's over."

I spoke with a female witness on the scene and explained that we received a report of an assault where the suspect allegedly racked a firearm after a confrontation between two parties, though the victim was not present. I conducted a search of Webb, locating keys on his person. I advised Webb that we would check him again at the station and that I would make him take his layers of clothing off for a further search.

Mr. Webb was placed under arrest and charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of a large capacity firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, and assault with a dangerous weapon.
