Narrative: On Wednesday, January 25, 2023, at approximately [INSERT: time], officers assigned to Boston's B3 District responded to a call regarding a person with a gun in the area of 1509 Blue Hill Avenue. Upon locating a male subject matching the description, later identified as Santiago Webb, 47, of Mattapan, I approached him and asked him to take his hands out of his pockets. Webb claimed his hands were out of his pockets while they remained concealed and stated, "Don't pull for me." Webb then began walking away from me. I ordered officers to handicap the suspect. During the detention, a firearm was recovered from Webb’s front waistband. The weapon was identified as a loaded SCCY CPX2 9mm pistol with 10 rounds in the magazine.

Following the recovery of the weapon, I asked Webb if he possessed a License to Carry (LTC) or a license to carry a firearm in the state. Webb verbally confirmed that he did not have an LTC. I then read Webb his Miranda rights from a card, advising him of his right to remain silent, that anything he said could be used against him in a court of law, and his right to consult with a lawyer. Webb indicated he understood his rights by saying, "Okay." I further advised him that he could waive these rights or stop answering questions at any time. When asked for identification, Webb stated he did not have an ID on his person but verbally provided his name and spelling.

The incident originated from a report of an assault with a firearm involving a confrontation between two parties, during which the suspect allegedly racked the slide of the firearm. Based on the recovery of the weapon and Webb's lack of licensure, he was placed under arrest. Webb was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of a large capacity firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, and assault with a dangerous weapon. Officers on scene indicated Webb would be searched further upon transport to the station.
