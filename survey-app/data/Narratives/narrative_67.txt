Narrative:
I arrived on the scene where an individual was heard asking, "Is it open?" and "Watch your foot," followed by the statement, "Just try it." I made contact with the subject and asked where he was headed. The subject stated he was headed to his house "right here" on Bolton. When I asked where he was coming from, he appeared unable to provide a specific location, repeatedly stating, "I just came from... I don't know," and mentioned he was on his way home. I engaged the subject in conversation regarding his brother and his history of police stops; he claimed he had not been stopped in a while.

I received information regarding a dispatch call, noting "1143 Blue" and that a team was sent out regarding a report of individuals "fighting the staff." I explained to the subject that we were trying to figure out "which position" and asked if he had any weapons on his person. The subject gave an unclear response, stating, "I'll take it." I instructed an individual named Chris to come back towards my location. At this point, the subject became agitated, asking, "What the fuck?" and "What the fuck is going on?" I advised him that it was believed [INSERT: witnesses/officers] saw something and that we were checking it out. The subject denied involvement, asking what I was talking about. I instructed him to "just be cool" and "relax."

I informed the subject that I was going to read him something from a card shortly. I asked again if he had any weapons, and he replied, "I don't got no weapons on me at all." I identified two phones in his possession and placed them into his front pocket. I asked the subject for his first name, and he identified himself as Tanaji. I explained that the body camera recording was active. I then asked Tanaji, "Do you have a Miranda card? Or do you want to read it?" I attempted to speak with another officer identified as "Obi" regarding the situation. No specific probable cause for an arrest was explicitly stated in the recording beyond the investigation into the report of fighting.
