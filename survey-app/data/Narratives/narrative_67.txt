Narrative:
At about 10:18 p.m. on Friday, April 19, 2024, I was on patrol with members of the Youth Violence Strike Force, also known as the Gang Unit, in the area of Washington Street and Erie Street. We observed a motor vehicle operating at a high rate of speed. We activated our cruiser's emergency lights and sirens to initiate a traffic stop. Upon stopping the vehicle and making contact with the operator, officers observed in plain view what appeared to be the grip of a firearm. We requested the occupants to exit the vehicle and conducted a pat frisk.

Officers recovered a firearm from inside the vehicle, which was later determined to be a Glock 26 containing one round in the chamber and 21 rounds in an extended magazine. We placed both occupants into handcuffs. One occupant was identified as Tynagle Belgrave [INSERT: Date of Birth/Address Details]. During the interaction, Belgrave stated he was headed to his house on Bolton and denied having any weapons on his person. Officers placed two phones into Belgrave’s front pocket.

Belgrave repeatedly asked officers what was going on and was instructed to relax. An officer located a Miranda card to provide warnings to the suspect. Belgrave was placed under arrest and charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, and unlawful possession of a large capacity feeding device. He was subsequently arraigned in Dorchester District Court.
