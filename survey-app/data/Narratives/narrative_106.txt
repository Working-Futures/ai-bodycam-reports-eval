Narrative:
At [INSERT: Date and Time], I was involved in a traffic incident at [INSERT: Specific Location] involving a vehicle that had been observed driving in a "crazy way." Another officer stated the vehicle was traveling at 90 MPH, although the operator claimed he thought he was traveling at 30 MPH. I approached the vehicle and requested a license, which was provided. The occupants, including [INSERT: Name of other occupants], informed us they were visiting a cousin and had just arrived from Florida. I asked the individuals if they had "nothing crazy" or anything with their name on it in the vehicle, to which they responded in the negative.

During a search of the vehicle, officers discovered a significant amount of U.S. currency disguised in a light fixture. Upon this discovery, one of the occupants exclaimed, "Oh my god, dude, that's a ton of money." An individual, identified as Mr. Lara, appeared visibly nervous, stating, "You don't see my legs shaking, bro," and noting the temperature difference compared to Florida. There was further discussion on scene regarding a check to ensure no firearms were missing. It was determined that police recovered roughly 41 grams of crack cocaine, 68 grams of fentanyl, along with $50,556 in U.S. currency.

Mr. Lara was arrested on site and charged with trafficking of Class A, trafficking of Class B, and possession with intent to distribute Class D. Following the arrest, an individual requested a favor regarding his father's truck keys, explaining that he and his mother had driven the truck from Florida. I informed him that we would leave the keys at the front desk for retrieval. Mr. Lara was subsequently arraigned in Dorchester District Court.
