Narrative:
On Thursday, April 25th, 2024, at approximately 2:00 a.m., I was present at Emerson College alongside Captain Sean Martin of District A1 and other officers regarding a protest encampment. Captain Martin attempted to de-escalate the situation, advising the protesters that while the department supports their right to protest and did not want to arrest anyone, the "block in the street" could not be allowed. He explained that "fire codes" were being broken, a nearby building required emergency access, and the department was receiving complaints from residents because it was late. Captain Martin informed the group that they were supposed to "come down about 10 p.m." and that he had given them several hours extra to finish their finals and protest peacefully without blocking the public way.

An officer subsequently utilized a sound system to read a warning regarding City Ordinance Section 16-65, the "Camping Ordinance," passed on October 25, 2023. The officer advised the crowd that this ordinance prohibits persons from camping or maintaining campsite materials in any public right of way—including streets, sidewalks, schools, or public parks—unless specifically authorized during a period when shelter is unavailable. The officer further read the protocols stating that if an individual accepts an offer of shelter, officers would work with the coordinated response team to find placement.

Following these warnings, the protesters continued to chant "Free, free Palestine" and did not disperse. Officers then took action to clear the public area of the protesters and the encampment. Commands were issued to "take the person with the backpack" and "grab onto them," as well as instructions to move a vehicle and "push the sidewalk back beyond the obedience." During the intervention, four officers were injured, with one officer sustaining serious but non-life-threatening injuries. A total of 108 individuals were arrested and are set to be arraigned in Boston Municipal Court on either May 1st or May 8th, as confirmed by Sergeant John Boyle.
