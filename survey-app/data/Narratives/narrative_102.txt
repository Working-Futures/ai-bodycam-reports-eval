Narrative:
On Thursday, April 25th, 2024, at approximately 0200 hours, I was present at an incident involving a group of demonstrators. When an individual asked why they were being surrounded, an assisting officer replied that we were ready to talk. I addressed the group, explaining that we did not want to arrest anybody and supported their right to protest. I stated that while I was indifferent to their specific cause, the block in the street and the violation of fire codes could not be allowed to continue. I advised them that a building at the location required emergency access and that they needed to permit people to leave the area. I noted that although the group was supposed to have concluded activity around 10:00 p.m., I had provided several hours of extra time to be reasonable. I reiterated that we did not want anyone to get hurt or miss school finals, but the current obstruction in the street had to be removed.

The individuals present continued to chant. An officer then read Camping Ordinance Section 16-65 aloud to the group. The officer stated that the ordinance prohibits persons from camping or maintaining campsite materials in any space in the public right of way, including any street, sidewalk, school, or public park, unless authorized during a period when shelter is unavailable. The officer advised that if an individual accepted an offer of shelter, officers would work with the coordinated response team to identify placement. The officer noted that the camera was rolling and that they would be providing this warning twice.

Following the warnings, directives were issued to enforcement units on the scene. An officer gave the command to "take the person with the backpack" and "grab onto them." Instructions were given to [INSERT: specific vehicle maneuver] and to push [INSERT: specific subject being pushed] back beyond the [INSERT: specific boundary]. The incident resulted in the arrest of 108 individuals, who were set to be arraigned in Boston Municipal Court, and four officers sustained injuries.
