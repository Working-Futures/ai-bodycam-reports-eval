Narrative:
At about 7:48 p.m. on Friday, May 3rd, 2024, while working as a member of the Drug Control Unit of District A7, East Boston, officers were conducting an ongoing drug investigation in the area of Bayswater Street and Shawsheen Road when we observed a street-level drug transaction. We requested the assistance of a marked cruiser to conduct a traffic stop and made contact with the occupants in the area of 3 Almond Street. We advised the two males, identified as Adrian Salmerin and Kevin Cartagena, of the reason for the stop and requested them to exit the vehicle [INSERT: vehicle description].

Officers conducted a pat frisk of one of the individual's backpacks [INSERT: name of individual with backpack] and recovered a box of ammunition. As officers were placing the suspects into handcuffs, one of the suspects [INSERT: name of individual with firearm] raised his arms, and officers immediately observed the handle of a firearm in his waistband. The firearm was later determined to be a Glock 19, with one round in the chamber and 15 rounds in the magazine. Officers also recovered from inside the vehicle approximately $3,079 in U.S. currency, about 67 various cannabis packages, and a box of ammunition containing 23 rounds.

I advised the suspect [INSERT: name of suspect being advised] of his rights, specifically stating that he has the right to an attorney and that we would provide one at no cost to himself. When asked if he understood those rights, the individual responded, "Okay." Officers asked the individual where he was coming from and noted that he "watched the whole thing." We informed the suspect that we would search him again to ensure he had no further contraband. We confirmed the suspect had no weapons on his person before placing him in the wagon for transport, noting that a further check would be conducted at the station. Salmerin and Cartagena were arrested on firearm and drug charges.
