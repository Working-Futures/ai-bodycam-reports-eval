Narrative:
At the scene located at Almonte, I confirmed my location with dispatch as unit 131. I engaged with a male subject and advised him of his constitutional rights. I stated that he had the right to an attorney and that counsel would be provided at no cost to him. When I asked if he understood those rights, the subject responded, "Okay." I proceeded to question the subject about his movements, asking where he was coming from and stating that he was going somewhere after that. I noted that he had met up with someone and had "watched the whole thing," urging him to be honest with me.

I remarked to assisting officers that the individuals involved were "grown men" and were "holding." I further stated that I was unsure if "Gold" had attacked them. We determined that the subject would be placed in the transport wagon. Prior to loading him, I informed the subject that we were going to catch him down one more time. I asked the subject if he had anything else on his person, advising him that we would find any contraband regardless because we were removing his items. My partner confirmed that the subject had no weapons. I advised that we would conduct a further check of the subject at the station. During the search, I located an item on the subject and asked, "Is it a chain?"
