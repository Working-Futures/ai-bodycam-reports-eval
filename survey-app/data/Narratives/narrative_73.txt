Narrative:
I observed a male subject looking at his phone and approached him. I issued verbal commands for him to stay right there, show me his hands, and put them right behind his back. The subject complied with these commands. I advised the subject, addressed as Chris, that at any time during questioning, he could cancel questions. I asked if he understood his rights and informed him that he was not under arrest, but that we possessed a search warrant for his car, his body, and his apartment for drugs. When asked if anyone was in the apartment at [INSERT: specific address], the subject confirmed that two children were inside. We determined that the subject had not yet been fully searched, and officers coordinated to ensure he remained detained downstairs.

Officers confirmed possession of the keys and noted that the camera was running. We approached the apartment door and knocked, repeatedly announcing, “Boston Police, we have a search warrant for this apartment.” After waiting for a full 30 seconds, we entered the residence. Inside, we encountered two females and two children. We cleared the apartment to ensure no other individuals were present and confirmed the scene was safe. An officer asked, "JD, you want these off?" regarding restraints, to which another officer replied, "Yeah."

Supervisor Sean Dineen of the Boston Police Drug Squad introduced himself and members of the FBI to the occupants. Supervisor Dineen explained that a few officers had been conducting a long-term investigation into Craig illegally selling narcotics on the streets of Boston. He stated that we had applied for and received a search warrant for the apartment. Supervisor Dineen further explained that officers had secured Craig Norman's car downstairs and that Craig was currently downstairs where he had been informed of the situation.

Supervisor Dineen advised the occupants that we would be conducting a comprehensive search, which would involve taking pictures, to locate the items sought. We provided copies of the search warrant for the occupants to read. Supervisor Dineen asked if they had any questions, to which they responded in the negative. We then allowed one of the occupants to go to their room to retrieve an iPad.
