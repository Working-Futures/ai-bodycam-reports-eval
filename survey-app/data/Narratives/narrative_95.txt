Narrative:
On Tuesday, February 14, 2023, at approximately 9:11 a.m., I, along with [INSERT: names of assisting officers], responded to the vicinity of 442 Blue Hill Avenue in Dorchester to execute an on-site arrest warrant for 54-year-old Ayala Raquel. We were aware that Raquel was wanted on several warrants out of Roxbury District Court on charges of armed robbery, assault by means of a dangerous weapon, and malicious destruction of property. Upon making contact with the suspect, she stated she was not going to run. An assisting officer informed Raquel that she had "a lot of warrants." Raquel disputed this, claiming she had already cleared a warrant related to a Walgreens incident after spending 12 hours in custody. She further stated the current issue was related to her sister taking her to court regarding her son and a missed court date.

We advised Raquel that we needed to clear the active warrants and instructed her to put her hands behind her back. Officers observed she was wearing a backpack and a fanny pack. We requested she remove the backpack, explaining that she could not ride in the back of the police vehicle with it on. Raquel became non-compliant, insisting the bag "doesn't come off" and stating her Bible was inside. She continued to argue that the bag would not come off for anyone, despite officers observing the straps. We eventually managed to remove the backpack to search it incident to arrest.

During the search of the backpack and her property, officers located spoons, bottles, lighters, and multiple rocks. Raquel became agitated when officers handled a specific item, identifying it as her "ticket" and stating it was a lottery ticket that was very important to her. We assured her the item would go with her. During a search of her person, Raquel complained about her shirt being lifted, stating we were "flashing" her. Due to the cold weather and the volume of items in her possession—which an officer described as "trash" and "too much stuff"—we decided to transport the property back to the B-2 district station to conclude the search. We placed her money inside her fanny pack and prepared her for transport.
