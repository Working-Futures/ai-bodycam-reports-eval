Narrative:
On [INSERT: Date/Time], I made contact with a female subject, identified as Raquel, regarding outstanding warrants. I informed Raquel that she had multiple warrants. She disputed the number of warrants, claiming she had already cleared a warrant related to a Walgreens incident by serving twelve hours, but she acknowledged she had missed a court date regarding a dispute with her sister involving her son. I advised her that we needed to clear the current warrant and instructed her to place her hands behind her back.

Raquel was compliant with being handcuffed but refused to remove a backpack she was wearing. She claimed the bag would not come off and expressed concern for a Bible located inside. I explained that she could not ride in the back of the police car with the backpack on. When assisting officers and I attempted to remove the bag, Raquel became agitated and physically resistant. During the interaction, she stood on my legs, requiring me to instruct her to stand up straight and relax. She also accused me of "flashing" her; I denied this and adjusted her shirt to ensure she was covered while she continued to scream and resist.

I removed her fanny pack to conduct a search. Raquel stated there was an important ticket inside. A search of the fanny pack revealed a lottery ticket and currency; I informed her I would put the money back in the pack. A search of her other loose property revealed spoons, bottles, lighters, and rocks. Due to the volume of property and the chaotic nature of the scene, I determined I would transport the items to B2 to finish the search at the station.

Raquel was taken into custody based on several warrants out of Roxbury District Court, which included charges for armed robbery, assault by means of a dangerous weapon, and malicious destruction of property. No Miranda warnings were recorded during the duration of this transcript.
