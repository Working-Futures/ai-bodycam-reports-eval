Narrative:
I located a male subject, verbally identified as Christopher Hollis, inside a [INSERT: specific location or building]. Upon making contact, I asked Hollis if he was supposed to be there. He replied that he had nowhere to go and claimed he was sleeping inside because his feet were hurting. Hollis admitted that he just opened the door to enter and slept there. I asked him for identification, but he stated he did not have any. Throughout the initial interaction, Hollis attempted to walk away multiple times, stating he would leave, and I ordered him to stay at the scene and stop walking away.

During the encounter, I observed Hollis reaching into a bag in his possession. I ordered him to stop reaching into the bag and to put it down. Hollis insisted the bag contained only food, candy, and a sweatshirt, but subsequently admitted that he had a knife. I informed him that I needed to pat him down to locate the weapon. Hollis continued to reach toward his pockets and reached for the knife, at which point I ordered him to stop reaching and explained that he could not reach for a weapon while with a police officer. I also noted that Hollis was holding a flashlight.

Investigation revealed that a crate was located by the door, which was found unlocked and partially open with Hollis inside. I observed that the gate lock appeared to have been tampered with; the chain had been placed back around to appear secured but came right off when pulled. Hollis denied breaking any windows to gain entry.

I recognized Hollis from multiple prior interactions. A check of his record confirmed that he had five active warrants. Based on the warrants, Hollis was taken into custody. [INSERT: specific details regarding arrest processing or transport].
