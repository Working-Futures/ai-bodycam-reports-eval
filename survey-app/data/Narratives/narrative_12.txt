Narrative:
I responded to the location identified as Dimmock's regarding a reported incident involving a vehicle and a pedestrian. Upon arrival, I made contact with a male subject who was the driver of a rental sedan. The subject appeared agitated and stated that unknown males started punching him and kicking his car. He explained that approximately five individuals tried to enter his vehicle, causing him to back up and then pull forward to escape. The subject emphatically stated, "I didn't hit no woman," and informed us that his hand was broken and he had recently undergone surgery. Officers on the scene observed fingerprints on the vehicle's windows, which appeared consistent with the subject's account of the vehicle being attacked.

During the interview, the subject voluntarily stated, "I got a warrant." This information was acknowledged by officers on the scene. It was observed that the subject smelled of alcohol; when confronted with the statement "I can smell alcohol all over your breath," the subject admitted, "I was just drinking." He later stated, "I smoke weed, that's it." Due to the subject's admission of drinking and the existence of the warrant, he was advised that he could not drive the vehicle.

An inventory search of the vehicle was conducted prior to towing. During this process, the subject requested his wallet and stated, "I only got weed" inside his bag. Officers located a bag containing marijuana. The subject complied with instructions but remained agitated regarding the earlier altercation. He was detained and placed in the rear of a patrol vehicle based on the warrant. The vehicle was confirmed to be a rental registered to the subject's name and was cleared to be towed.
