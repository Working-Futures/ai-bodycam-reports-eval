Narrative: I responded to a call regarding a male party stating that a child's mother was driving erratically in a silver Chevy, with a mention of "unknown play with children and people." The reporting party claimed he was no longer in the area. Upon making contact with the occupants of a silver Chevy, I asked if they had any identification or licenses. The occupants indicated they had "none whatsoever" and I observed that nobody in the vehicle was wearing a seatbelt. The occupants confirmed that the vehicle was a rental car and not owned by them.

I proceeded to gather identifying information from the individuals. One male subject identified himself as "Abel" and acknowledged the name "Jefferson," though he initially struggled to provide a complete date of birth, eventually mentioning the year 2000. Another male occupant was able to present a picture of his ID, allowing me to obtain his information. A third individual stated he did not know his full social security number and could only provide the last four digits. The group advised they were from Lynn.

To further the investigation, I instructed the occupants to "step off the seatbelt" and exit the vehicle. I asked if they had any weapons on them. The subjects complied with the instruction to exit and stood by as directed. During the detainment, [INSERT: Name of Speaker 01] asked if I had "padded" them down, indicating a pat-down search of the subjects was conducted.
