Narrative:
At about 12:35 a.m. on Saturday, March 9, 2024, members of the Youth Violence Strike Force, also known as the Gang Unit, and I were on patrol in the area of Massachusetts Avenue Connector when we observed a motor vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed. We immediately activated our cruisers' emergency lights and sirens to initiate a traffic stop. We made contact with the operator and requested his driver's license, which he was unable to produce a physical copy of. We observed the car to be occupied by four other passengers and noticed that they were not wearing their seatbelts.

We requested identification from all occupants, but one occupant refused to roll down his window. At this time, we requested the occupants to exit the vehicle. All occupants exited the vehicle except for Abel Severino Reyes, who continued to disregard our orders. After multiple attempts, we were able to have Reyes exit the vehicle and conducted a pat frisk.

During the search, we immediately recovered a large plastic bag containing a soft, powdery substance from inside the suspect's jacket pocket. The seized drugs were later determined to be fentanyl with a weight of 101 grams. Severino Reyes was placed under arrest and charged with trafficking of Class A. During the investigation on scene, we attempted to identify the remaining passengers, who indicated they did not have physical identification on their persons, although one individual eventually stated he had a picture of his ID. The passengers were patted down for safety during the interaction.
