Narrative:
I arrived on the scene and engaged with a subject regarding a potential incident. The subject initially stated, "I don't think it's a police matter." I asked the subject if he had any drugs on him, to which he responded, "No." An assisting officer advised the subject, "We're going to get you to court." When the officer asked if the incident concerned "Larceny or stealing from a stop and shop," the subject confirmed, "Yeah, a stop and shop."

I asked the subject if he had anything on his person, and he replied, "Nothing on me, I'm good." I informed him, "We'll see if we have anything else." The subject, identified as Oscar Cronin, was placed in handcuffs. Mr. Cronin spoke to a third party, stating, "I'm in handcuffs right now," and indicated he was being transported to "B2 Station" while requesting that the individual check on his bail. I confirmed that Mr. Cronin did not have anything on his person, stating, "There we go," [INSERT: specific search method used]. I noted a description of a "Black male, thirties, uh, blue, black shirt."
