Narrative:
On Monday, March 20th, 2023, officers with Boston's B2 District responded to a call of a person with a gun in a crowd of at least 50 people. As soon as we arrived on scene, the suspect fled on foot, and a foot pursuit ensued. During the chase, we observed the suspect throw what was later confirmed to be a firearm under a car. After a brief chase and struggle, we arrested the suspect, identified as Yeltsin Gonzalez Falcon, 31, of Rosslandale. We located the firearm under the vehicle, along with a flashlight that Officer Craig had lost during the incident. When I asked Yeltsin if he had a license to carry a gun, he admitted, "No, I don't have a license." He mentioned he was bleeding, and we advised him that we would get him medical attention. We then conducted a search of his person, checking his pockets.

While we were dealing with Yeltsin, a vehicle driven by a second individual, later identified as Roberto Hernandez Falcon, pulled around the corner and almost drove over Officer Craig's foot. We commanded him to "Stop the car" and "Put it in park" multiple times. Roberto argued with us, stating, "Yo, that's not my problem, man," regarding the safety of the officer. Roberto attempted to exit his vehicle by striking one of the officers and attempting to grab another officer while shouting. We attempted to force him back into the vehicle, but he remained non-compliant, repeatedly stating, "I'm a fucking truck driver" and "I just want to go home" while refusing to stop his aggressive behavior.

Following his refusal to comply and the physical altercation, Roberto Hernandez Falcon was taken into custody after a brief struggle. Roberto was charged with interfering with a police officer and assault and battery on a police officer. Yeltsin Gonzalez Falcon was arrested on firearms-related charges. Both men were secured and processed accordingly.
