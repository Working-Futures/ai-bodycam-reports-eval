Narrative:
I was present at the scene where a subject vehicle attempted to maneuver away from officers. The driver, later identified as Roberto Hernandez Falcon, failed to comply with repeated commands to "stop the car" and "put it in park." During this sequence, the vehicle nearly ran over Officer Craig's foot. Simultaneous to the vehicle moving, an occupant was observed dumping an object under the car. Upon immediate inspection of the undercarriage, the object was identified as a firearm. I issued commands for the occupants to exit the vehicle and questioned the individual identified as Yeltsin Gonzalez Falcon regarding the weapon. I asked, "Where's your license to carry?" and "Do you have a license to have a gun?" Yeltsin Gonzalez Falcon responded, "No, I don't have a license."

Roberto Hernandez Falcon remained non-compliant throughout the interaction. He attempted to exit his vehicle aggressively, striking one officer and attempting to grab another officer while shouting. We issued commands to "stop resisting" and "put your hands behind your back," but he continued to struggle. Officers were forced to physically restrain him to effect the arrest. During the struggle, Roberto Hernandez Falcon stated, "I'm bleeding," and was advised that we would secure medical attention for him. 

I directed Yeltsin Gonzalez Falcon to sit on the curb, where I located his wallet. I advised him of his Miranda warning, specifically stating that he had the right to be silent. During questioning, he identified himself as a truck driver and stated he "just wanted to go home," claiming the vehicle's movement was not his problem. A search was conducted of the suspects and the immediate area, which confirmed the location of the firearm under the vehicle and located a flashlight belonging to Officer Craig.

Based on the investigation and the firearm located at the scene, Yeltsin Gonzalez Falcon was placed under arrest on firearms-related charges. Roberto Hernandez Falcon was taken into custody and charged with interfering with a police officer and assault and battery on a police officer. Both subjects were secured for transport.
