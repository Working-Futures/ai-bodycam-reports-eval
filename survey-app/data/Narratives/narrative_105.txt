Narrative: upon arrival at the incident location, I proceeded to the front door and opened it. I located a male subject, later identified as Mr. King [INSERT: First Name]. I observed a firearm on Mr. King’s person, which was tucked as if it had been in his hoodie pocket. Concerned about whether the subject had self-inflicted injuries, I immediately seized the weapon to secure the scene, confirming aloud that it was real and loaded. I decided to secure Mr. King immediately, noting that I grabbed him one-handed to place him in handcuffs because I did not want to wake him up prior to securing him.

Once Mr. King was handcuffed, I verified his consciousness by asking, "Sir, you with it?" and "You know where you are?" I then demanded to see his license to carry a firearm. After I repeated the demand, Mr. King admitted, "I never had a license." Following this admission, I read Mr. King his Miranda warnings, advising him of his right to remain silent, that anything he said could be used against him in a court of law, his right to consult with a lawyer before answering questions, and that a lawyer would be provided by the Commonwealth if he could not afford one. When asked if he understood what I told him, Mr. King replied, "No." During subsequent interaction, Mr. King stated, "I don't have nothing," and when asked his name and if he knew what he was wearing, he gave conflicting or unclear responses.

Officers recovered the firearm, which was identified as a 9mm polymer 80PF940C with three rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber. Investigation revealed Mr. King had a prior firearm conviction in 2015. Based on the seizure of the loaded weapon and Mr. King's statement that he did not possess a license, probable cause existed to charge him with possession of a firearm without an FID card (subsequent offense), possession of ammunition without an FID card, and possession of a large capacity firearm. Mr. King was subsequently arraigned in Dorchester District Court.
