Narrative:

I observed a firearm on the person of a male subject, later identified as Mr. King. Upon observation, I noted the weapon was real and loaded. The firearm was tucked as if it had been in the subject's hoodie pocket. I secured Mr. King one-handed, as I did not initially want to wake him up, and instructed [INSERT: partner/other officer] to place him in handcuffs. I asked Mr. King if he was "with it" and if he knew where he was. I then demanded to see his license to carry a firearm. Mr. King stated, "I never had a license." When I asked him if he had any idea what he was wearing, he replied, "Yeah, I do," but when asked for his name, he stated, "I don't even know what."

I read Mr. King his Miranda rights, advising him that he had the right to remain silent, that anything he said could be used against him in a court of law, that he had the right to consult with a lawyer before answering questions, and that if he could not afford one, a lawyer would be provided by the Commonwealth. When I asked Mr. King if he understood what I told him, he answered, "No." I acknowledged his response and ordered for him to be removed from the scene.

Officers recovered the weapon, which was identified as a 9mm polymer 80PF940C containing three rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber. Investigation revealed that Mr. King had a prior firearm conviction in 2015. Based on the evidence recovered and Mr. King's admission regarding his lack of licensure, he was placed under arrest and charged with possession of a firearm without an FID card (subsequent offense), possession of ammunition without an FID card, and possession of a large capacity firearm. Mr. King was subsequently processed for arraignment at Dorchester District Court.
