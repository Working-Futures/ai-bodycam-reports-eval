Narrative:
I initiated contact with a male subject, later identified as Christopher Alves. I asked Alves if he was aware of any active warrants, and he stated that he had cleared them in court approximately four weeks prior. I requested his identification details, and he provided his name and Social Security number [INSERT: Social Security Number]. I instructed Alves to keep his hands behind him and sit on the ground to ensure he did not attempt to flee. Alves complied with these instructions and asked if he could smoke a cigarette, which I permitted.

I informed Alves that the stop was regarding a trespass incident at Whole Foods. Alves denied entering the store, stating, "I didn't go," and claimed that the bag in his possession contained nothing from the business. He alleged that he had been attacked and that his bag had been cut. I advised Alves that he was observed leaving Whole Foods with unpaid merchandise. Alves insisted the items belonged to him and were from his house. During the detention, I also asked Alves if he had been at Target earlier that morning. Alves vehemently denied being at Target or taking the train, stating, "That is a lie."

Dispatch confirmed Alves's identity. I communicated with assisting officers regarding the shoplifting report. An assisting officer asked if Alves should be locked up. I advised Alves that he was not under arrest at that moment, but that he was being detained so we could return to the scene to verify the events and the merchandise. I explained that we could not release him until the investigation was complete. I coordinated with another officer to transport Alves back to the scene to address the shoplifting and trespassing allegations. I took possession of the bag containing the alleged stolen items to return them to the business for verification.
