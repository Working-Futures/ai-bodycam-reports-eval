Narrative:
I approached the individual, [INSERT: Suspect Name], and repeatedly ordered him to put his hands behind his back. The suspect initially questioned these commands, asking "For what?" several times, and requested that I not "make a fucking scene." I informed the suspect that he had an outstanding warrant and was currently listed as one of "Boston's Most Wanted." The suspect disputed this status, claiming he had "cleared all [his] warrants up" at BMC "one summer long" and stated he had been to five courthouses recently. I confirmed to the suspect that he was the individual sought by the agency.

Despite the suspect’s claims that the situation was a "joke" and that he did not recognize me, I detained him. He asked if he could take "these" off, referring to the restraints, and I replied, "No." I offered to show him the "Boston's Most Wanted" image to verify his identity, which he continued to question. During the interaction, the suspect recalled that I may have "locked [him] up" approximately three to five years prior.

While detained, the suspect admitted, "I just hid in my bag." I asked him where in the bag he had hidden, and he replied, "In like a thing." Due to safety concerns regarding the potential presence of a firearm, I informed the suspect that I would not search the bag on the scene but would instead bring it into the station. The suspect asked, "We're not going to get stabbed?" to which I replied negatively. I advised the suspect of a "new charge" in addition to the warrants. The suspect was subsequently transported from the scene.
