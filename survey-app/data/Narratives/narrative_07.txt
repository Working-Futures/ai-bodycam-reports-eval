Narrative:
I arrived on the scene and made contact with a male individual, identified as Tomas. I instructed Tomas to take a seat and informed him that his motorcycle would need to be towed because it did not have a visible license plate or plaque. I explained that operating the motorcycle without a plate was a violation comparable to driving a car without a plate and that he could not drive it on the street until the issue was resolved. I requested his identification; Tomas provided his first name and engaged in a discussion regarding whether he had his physical ID or a picture of it. I advised him that he could remove his personal property, specifically a sweatshirt, from the bike before it was taken.

During the interaction, the subject became agitated, exclaiming that he had to go and expressing concern regarding his food. I issued repeated verbal commands for the subject to "Give me your hand." Following these commands, I stated that the subject was in custody and advised him to slow down. The specific basis for the transition from the towing procedure to the custodial arrest is [INSERT: specific probable cause for arrest], and it is noted that [INSERT: whether Miranda warnings were issued] as this information was not audible in the transcript.

After the subject was taken into custody, there was a discussion regarding an individual who had "ran" because he knew I was home. The subject also made disjointed statements regarding money and "buying help." During the course of these events, I noted damage to an Apple Watch. The subject was secured, and the incident was processed accordingly.
