Narrative:

On [INSERT: Date and Time], Officer Ames and I were present at the rear of 275 Center. An officer advised that we had a subject right behind us. The subject, who was on the ground, asked to be let up. I instructed the subject to relax and explained that he needed to be cuffed before we would let him up. During the detention, I explicitly demanded the subject’s license to carry. The subject responded, "But I don't have it," and another officer confirmed, "You don't have it?"

Once the subject was secured, I instructed Officer Bert to sit him up. We coordinated via radio channel 13 regarding transport to District 2. An officer on scene remarked regarding the subject that "he walked by me in his pocket." We confirmed that we had secured the object in question. The subject again asked to be let out, and I advised him to relax and not get worked up, noting that the scene was safe and he was being recorded on body-worn camera.

Upon inspection, the recovered gun was found to be fully loaded with one round in the chamber and 12 rounds in the magazine. The suspect, identified as a 15-year-old juvenile, was subsequently charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of a large capacity firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, and trespassing.
