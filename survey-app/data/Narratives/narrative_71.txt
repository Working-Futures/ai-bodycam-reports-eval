Narrative:
At about 10:30 a.m. on Monday, April 8, 2024, I, along with members of the District C-11 Dorchester Drug Control Unit, was on patrol in the area of 157 Washington Street to address the ongoing community complaints about drug use and drug dealing. Officers observed an individual being approached multiple times by other individuals. These conversations only lasted a few seconds, and then the individuals would separate from one another. We believed that street-level drug transactions were occurring and attempted to stop the main suspect.

As officers approached the suspect, he reached into his vest and began to sprint from officers. A foot pursuit ensued, and officers were able to apprehend the suspect. [INSERT: specific missing detail regarding physical apprehension actions]. As officers canvassed the flight path of the suspect, we recovered a discarded plastic bag containing two bags of what is believed to be fentanyl and crack cocaine. During the incident, the suspect stated, "I swear to God," multiple times.

It was later determined that the fentanyl weighed 21 grams and the crack cocaine weighed approximately 6 grams. The suspect, identified as David Dillard, 19, of Boston, was placed under arrest and charged with trafficking of Class A and possession with intent to distribute Class B on drug trafficking charges.
