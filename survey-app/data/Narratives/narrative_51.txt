Narrative:
I was present at an incident involving a vehicle stop initially referenced near 4-5-6 Clifford Park. I observed a driver and a passenger, [INSERT: Name of Passenger], who had his pants hanging down and stated he did not have a belt because he had lost weight. The driver stated he was just picking the passenger up and offered to allow the passenger to ride with officers if the vehicle was an issue. Officers identified that the vehicle displayed a red inspection sticker. The driver claimed he had obtained the vehicle in September and believed he had a nine-day grace period. An officer corrected the driver, stating he had seven days and that the vehicle could not be on the road with the red package ticket.

Officers commanded the driver to shut off the car. The driver initially did not comply, stating, "I can't shut it off," before eventually shutting the vehicle down. An assisting officer explained that they previously had the vehicle pulled over, but the subjects "took off." Officers noted the vehicle was missing a plate. The incident concluded with a report of a "car crash to build[ing]" at the intersection of Millet and Southern. Officers confirmed there was no ETA for a trooper and proceeded to handle the scene.
