Narrative:
On [INSERT: Date/Time], at [INSERT: Location], I was on scene with [INSERT: Assisting Officer Name] assisting a male subject, [INSERT: Subject Name]. I informed the subject that we had an ambulance en route and intended to take care of him. I observed that the subject was behaving erratically and stated he was "not being normal." I instructed the subject to sit down to ensure he did not hit his head or fall. An assisting officer advised to place the subject on the ground or in handcuffs. While managing the subject, instructions were given to undo his belt.

The subject became highly agitated and combative, screaming profanities and racial slurs. He repeatedly demanded, "Help me up" and "Let me go," while asking, "Why the fuck am I in cuffs?" The subject complained of pain, specifically shouting, "Ow, my dick," and accused an individual of looking at his genitals. Despite commands to stop, the subject continued to yell, "What the fuck," and struggled against detention.

I subsequently read the subject his Miranda warnings. I advised him that he had the right to remain silent, that anything he said could be used against him in a court of law, that he had the right to consult with a lawyer before answering any questions, and that if he could not afford a lawyer, one would be provided to him by the Commonwealth without cost.

Following the advisement of rights, I asked the subject multiple times, "Do you understand what I've said to you?" and "Do you understand?" The subject did not provide an affirmative answer or indicate compliance; instead, he continued to scream, "What the fuck" and "Let me the fuck go" repeatedly.
