Narrative:
I asked the individual, [INSERT: Suspect Name], if he had any weapons on his person. He confirmed he did, stating it was on his "front right hip." He immediately stated, "Officer, that guy tried to hit me," apologized, and told me he would cooperate. He identified the weapon as a SIG 365. I asked if he had a License to Carry (LTC), and he replied, "Yep." He informed me the license was the fourth card on the left in his wallet.

I advised the individual that I was going to "set [him] up," and he remained compliant, stating, "Do what you got to do." I instructed him to roll back and assisted him physically. Upon confirming his wallet was in his left pocket, I located the specific card he described behind his bank card. During this process, the individual remarked, "Yeah, these people are crazy, man."

I observed that the individual appeared "a little scraped up" and asked him what happened. He explained that he hit a pothole as he was "coming down" and was attempting to make a turn to head back to his home address in South Boston. He alleged that "this guy was being an asshole" to him and pointed out blood on his left hand, noting the injury for my protection. I instructed him to sit tight and subsequently communicated via radio that I was at the call on the C4.
