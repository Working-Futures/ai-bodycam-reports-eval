Narrative:
I arrived at [INSERT: incident location] and made contact with a male subject, [INSERT: subject name]. I asked the subject, "Is this loaded?" and he replied, "No, sir." When asked for the location of the item, the subject stated, "It's tucked in there," and added, "I don't have nothing." I advised the subject to "be careful." The subject suggested taking his belt off and asked, "Okay, you want to check them?" I asked other individuals on the scene if they were with the subject, and they replied, "No, just the tow guys."

Another officer on scene stated, "There's a missing magazine somewhere," and instructed an officer identified as "Mighty" to "feel for a magazine." I questioned who was and was not with the subject. I ordered an individual to "please step back over there right now." I advised a male bystander, "Don't put your attitude with me, bro," and stated that I did not follow his talk. An officer instructed an individual named Sean to "pop the trunk" of [INSERT: vehicle description].

Regarding the basis of the call, I noted that the caller stated she "got adopted a dog from all their hands" and was "currently locked in the bedroom now." An officer described an item, stating, "I just left it as is, I just locked it in the bag." An agitated female bystander asked, "What is going on?" and stated she was going to her sister. I instructed her to "calm down" and told her she had "five seconds to get the fucking restaurant." Subsequently, an officer announced, "I got a magazine," confirming the recovery of evidence. Another officer noted, "No LCC mag yet."
