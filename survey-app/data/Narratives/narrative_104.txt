Narrative: On Monday, September 19, 2022, around 7:55 p.m., I responded to the area of Bullard Street for a report of a large fight. Upon arrival, officers observed a vehicle take off at a high rate of speed. I followed the vehicle and conducted a traffic stop in the area of Lithgow Street and Talbot Avenue in Dorchester. Upon approaching the vehicle, which contained five occupants, I requested identification. I informed one occupant that he was being identified because he was not wearing a seatbelt.

During the stop, I identified the driver as Hildo Vaz, who stated the car belonged to his father. I observed that Vaz's knuckles appeared to be "mocked up," indicating he may have had a hand in fighting. I identified a female passenger wearing a red jacket as Annalise Guerrero and another passenger as Joseph Williams Crawford. I observed that the occupants were extremely nervous, refusing to make eye contact, and one passenger nearly started crying when asked for his name. I also observed a baseball bat inside the vehicle.

Both Mr. Crawford and a 16-year-old juvenile male were removed from the vehicle and searched simultaneously. Crawford resisted officers and tried reaching for a firearm in his waist, but officers were able to take him into custody without further incident. At the same time, the 16-year-old juvenile male also began to resist and dropped a second firearm in the struggle before being taken into custody. During the altercation, I commanded the individuals to stop resisting and stop reaching, eventually announcing that I had control of the gun. A total of two firearms were recovered.

Following the arrests, I read a subject his Miranda rights, advising him of his right to remain silent and his right to consult with a lawyer. I demanded his license to carry. Hildo Vaz, Annalise Guerrero, and the remaining occupants were released from the scene. The stop resulted in the arrest of Joseph Williams Crawford, 21, of Dorchester, and the 16-year-old juvenile male on firearms-related charges.
