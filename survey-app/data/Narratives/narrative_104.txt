Narrative:
At approximately 1042 hours, I initiated a traffic stop on a vehicle bearing license plate 763 Yankee Tango 8 at [INSERT: specific location of stop]. I observed five occupants in the car and advised one passenger that the reason for the stop was an infraction for not wearing a seatbelt. I requested identification from the occupants. One male identified himself as Joseph Williams with a date of birth of 7/25/01. A female passenger in a red jacket identified herself as Annalise Guerrero with a date of birth in 2005. Another passenger identified himself as Hildo Vaz. I noted that the occupants appeared extremely nervous and refused to make eye contact. I recognized the driver as having a history involving firearms and identified another passenger as Mark Gentle, whom I knew from a previous incident involving a knife.

Due to the occupants' behavior and safety concerns, assisting officers and I decided to remove the individuals from the vehicle one at a time. During the interaction, I observed a baseball bat inside the vehicle. As officers attempted to remove the occupants, specifically Mr. Crawford and a 16-year-old juvenile male, a struggle ensued. Officers issued repeated commands to "stop resisting," "put your hands," and "get on the ground." An officer shouted "firearm accompanied" followed by urgent commands to "stop reaching" and "get the gun." Officers successfully secured the suspects and announced, "I have the gun." It was confirmed that two firearms were recovered at the scene: one from Mr. Crawford, who had reached for the weapon in his waist, and a second firearm dropped by the juvenile male during the struggle.

All occupants were placed in handcuffs. I read the Miranda warnings to the subjects, advising them of their right to remain silent and their right to consult with a lawyer. I demanded a License to Carry (LTC), but no license was produced. Following the investigation, I confirmed with Hildo Vaz that he was not the driver and that the vehicle belonged to his father. I informed Mr. Vaz and Ms. Guerrero that they would be released from the scene, while Mr. Crawford and the juvenile male were retained in custody.
