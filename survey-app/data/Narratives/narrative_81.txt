Narrative:
At about 12:48 a.m. on Saturday, March 23, 2024, while assigned to the Youth Violence Strike Force, I was on patrol on Washington Street near Erie Street. Officers observed a motor vehicle enter the opposite travel lane, pass the vehicle traveling in front of it, and continue on Washington Street at a high rate of speed estimated at about 50 miles per hour. A query of the motor vehicle led to the discovery that the vehicle had a revoked registration. We conducted a traffic stop at 13 Harvard Street in Dorchester.

I made contact with the operator, who initially identified himself as "Gerald Anderson" before correcting his name to Jerome Anderson (32, of Dorchester). When asked if he had a license, Anderson stated, "No, I don't got my license," and indicated the car belonged to his "girl." I informed Anderson he was "flying" and estimated his speed at 50 miles per hour. A female passenger was also present in the vehicle. Officers informed the passenger that the vehicle did not have insurance. Anderson and the passenger were removed from the vehicle.

During an inventory of the vehicle prior to towing, officers recovered a machete and an Interarms .45 caliber handgun loaded with one live .45 cartridge in the chamber and nine .45 cartridges in the magazine. Due to the proximity of the driver to the weapon, officers arrested Anderson. [INSERT: whether Miranda warnings were provided]. Anderson was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, possession of ammunition without an FID card, carrying a loaded firearm without a license, unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle, uninsured motor vehicle, and speeding.

Officers requested a tow for the vehicle and a transport unit to take Anderson to B3. The female passenger attempted to retrieve items including her purse and corn from the vehicle but was instructed to wait until officers were done.
