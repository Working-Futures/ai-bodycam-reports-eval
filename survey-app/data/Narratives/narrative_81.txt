Narrative: On [INSERT: Date/Time], I initiated a traffic stop on a [INSERT: Vehicle Make/Model] after observing the vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed. I approached the driver and advised him, "You're flying, bro," and noted he was coming "a little fast." I asked the driver if he had a license. He stated the vehicle belonged to his "girl" and initially mentioned she had a license. Upon direct questioning regarding his own status, the driver admitted, "No, I don't got my license." When asked for his name, the driver first identified himself as "Gerald," then "Gerald Anderson," before correcting himself and identifying as Jerome Anderson.

During the investigation, assisting officers instructed Anderson to relax and open the vehicle door, noting that the car likely did not have insurance. An officer observed an item described as looking like "the bottom of the blackout." I asked Anderson to provide his license to carry a firearm, and it was determined that he did not possess one. An assisting officer subsequently transmitted via radio that we would have a firearm recovered along with the traffic violations. The license plate was identified as 2 Harry Whiskey Golf 6-2.

A female subject present at the scene attempted to retrieve her purse, jacket, and other property from the vehicle. She was instructed to wait until we were done. When she attempted to move away or disengage, she was advised, "You're not free to leave," to which she repeatedly asked why. Officers requested a transport and a supervisor to the scene. It was communicated that the subjects would be transported to B3 to "get booked" and that the vehicle would be towed from the location of 13 Harvard Street.
