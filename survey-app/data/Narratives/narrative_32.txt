Narrative:
I was present at the scene where officers were physically restraining a subject [INSERT: subject name or description]. I observed officers controlling the subject's lower body and asked, "You got his legs?" I commanded the subject, "Let me see your right hand, bro," and repeatedly ordered him to "stop moving your right hand" as he appeared to be non-compliant. During the struggle, I located an object on the subject's person, stating, "I got his button, I'll find it," followed by, "I'll take it right here." After recovering the item and confirming possession with another officer, I announced, "We had a firearm," identifying the object as a weapon.

Following the recovery of the firearm, I commanded the subject not to move and instructed assisting officers to secure the area. I then turned my attention to the surrounding bystanders, repeatedly ordering everyone to "back up" and to "let us do our job." I continued to issue commands for the crowd to keep their distance while the scene was stabilized.

Officers proceeded to walk the subject away from the immediate area toward [INSERT: specific location or vehicle]. During this movement, I instructed the officers to "watch him." Once we began to move the subject out of the area, I ordered the officers to "search him again" and "search him one more time" to ensure he was thoroughly checked for any further contraband.
