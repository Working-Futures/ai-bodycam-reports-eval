Narrative:
I arrived on the scene and made contact with the suspect, identified as Kyle [INSERT: last name], who was located [INSERT: location description]. I commanded Kyle to keep his hands where they were. Kyle stated, "I got it in my pocket," and immediately began asserting that he "really didn't do this" and "didn't pull the knife out." He claimed the other party had lied about him threatening to kill them and suggested I check the camera. I instructed Kyle to stand up, get on his knees, and then move forward to a standing position. Kyle complied with these commands and was detained.

I explained to Kyle that two separate individuals identified him pulling a red knife with a silver blade. I advised him that the specificity of the witness description—specifically the "red knife"—matched the weapon he possessed. I recounted my observations leading up to the stop, noting that I saw Kyle "walking fast" or "speed walking," take a corner, and then run across the street. I stated that when I pulled up practically in front of him, I observed the knife in his right hand, at which point he dropped the knife and his bag. Another officer on scene confirmed that Kyle dropped the knife, and Kyle admitted, "Yeah, I dropped it," explaining he wanted to get rid of it in case we pulled up.

During the investigation, Kyle stated the dispute occurred at [INSERT: specific store name, transcript states 'CBS']. He claimed that while leaving, he told a man to get out of his way, and the man replied, "I'm gonna fucking kill you." Kyle alleged that both the manager and the other male said "screw you" to him. A search of Kyle’s bag was conducted, during which officers located items described as "small bills for the market." An assisting officer suggested we take the "stuff we took" back to the store. Kyle continued to deny threatening anyone or pulling the knife on people, stating, "I don't do that shit."
