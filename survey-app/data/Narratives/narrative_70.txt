Narrative:
I initiated contact with the driver of a black 2021 Nissan Murano, associated with the identifier "10-2-3." I requested the driver's license and registration, which they provided while asking, "What's going on? What'd I do?" I identified myself as being from Matisse. I proceeded to question the driver regarding their previous location. The driver initially provided vague answers, stating they were coming from "Down the street over there." When I noted that this description covered a long distance, the driver admitted they had "stopped doing like the gas" and were "talking to somebody over there." I asked if they had gone anywhere else besides Portugal, and the driver responded, "No." When I asked about the nature of the conversation they had with the other individual, the driver asked, "Are we having a show?"

I asked the driver if there was anything else in the vehicle and stated, "You already lied to us once." I informed the driver that I intended to check the vehicle to make the process quicker. The driver asked, "You're gonna warrant to check my vehicle?" I replied that we did not need one. I explained that we did not have a problem with the situation but referenced a "drug deal" and stated the basis for the stop was because the driver "stopped the other person" they met with.

I advised the driver regarding placing their hands behind their back. I then inquired about the location of the vehicle's key. The driver indicated that the key fob was inside the vehicle. I subsequently requested gloves from assisting officers, identified as Shelby and Nina, to facilitate a search of the vehicle.
