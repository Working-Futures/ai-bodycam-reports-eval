Narrative:
On Wednesday, April 10, 2024, at about 7:23 p.m., members of the District D-14 Alston-Brighton Drug Control Unit conducted a drug investigation involving Ivan Singleton, 63, of Dorchester. Drug control officers requested the assistance of a marked patrol cruiser to conduct a traffic stop of a suspected motor vehicle in the area of Commonwealth Avenue. I stopped the vehicle, identified as a black 2021 Nissan Murano. Upon contact, Singleton asked what was going on and what he did. When I asked where he was coming from, he provided vague answers, initially pointing and stating he was coming from "down the street." I advised him that the stop was related to an investigation where he was observed stopping to meet with another individual.

Following the investigation, officers recovered a pill bottle from the suspect containing two plastic bags believed to be fentanyl and crack cocaine. Singleton questioned if we needed a warrant to check his vehicle; I informed him that we did not need one. A motor vehicle inventory search was subsequently conducted. During this search, officers recovered approximately 17 grams of fentanyl, crack cocaine, various loose pills, digital scales, unused glass pipes, other drug paraphernalia, and $575 in U.S. currency.

Singleton was placed under arrest and charged with trafficking of Class A, distribution of Class B, two counts of possession with intent to distribute Class B, and possession with intent to distribute Class E. [INSERT: whether Miranda warnings were provided]. He was subsequently arraigned in Brighton District Court.
