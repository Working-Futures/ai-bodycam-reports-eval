I was present at the scene.
Officers were physically restraining a subject [INSERT: subject name or description].
I observed officers controlling the subject's lower body.
I asked, "You got his legs?"
I commanded the subject, "Let me see your right hand, bro."
I repeatedly ordered the subject to "stop moving your right hand."
The subject appeared to be non-compliant.
I located an object on the subject's person.
I stated, "I got his button, I'll find it."
I stated, "I'll take it right here."
I recovered the item.
I confirmed possession of the item with another officer.
I announced, "We had a firearm."
I identified the object as a weapon.
I commanded the subject not to move.
I instructed assisting officers to secure the area.
I turned my attention to the surrounding bystanders.
I repeatedly ordered everyone to "back up."
I ordered everyone to "let us do our job."
I issued commands for the crowd to keep their distance.
The scene was stabilized.
Officers proceeded to walk the subject away from the immediate area toward [INSERT: specific location or vehicle].
I instructed the officers to "watch him."
We began to move the subject out of the area.
I ordered the officers to "search him again."
I ordered the officers to "search him one more time."
The purpose of the search orders was to ensure the subject was thoroughly checked for further contraband.
