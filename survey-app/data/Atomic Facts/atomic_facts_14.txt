I initiated contact with an unidentified individual.
I asked the individual if they had an ID.
I stated that I needed to prove they were above 21.
I asked the subject if they had weed on them.
The subject replied, "It's in the bag."
I instructed the subject to take the bag off.
A remark was made that "the lemon's going off."
I told the individual, "So, come on and eat that."
I told an individual to "go in the car."
I advised responding units that they could still come in.
I advised responding units to slow it down.
Another officer instructed to "get the other kid in the car."
I issued a command to "Don't move."
I stated that they were all set up for help.
I requested assistance.
I stated, "Hey, can I get some help down here? I'm right in front of you."
The phrase "Put him in my pocket" was repeated multiple times.
I warned, "There's more right here, watch out."
I confirmed, "I got it."
An officer named Jesus was addressed with the question, "Got him?"
I observed that there was "another guy."
Multiple officers announced the discovery of "two guns" or "two firearms" repeatedly.
I requested, "Hey, give me some cops right here."
I issued a command to "put it on."
I stated, "I'm going to secure it."
I asked another officer, "Hey, you got both guns?"
The officer responded, "I got two guns."
I stated I was going to secure my gun.
An officer asked, "What kind of gun is that?"
An officer confirmed, "I got it on me."
