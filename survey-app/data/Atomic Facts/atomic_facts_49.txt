I was present during an incident.
The incident involved a vehicle described as an "Uber ride."
Observations were made regarding the vehicle's equipment.
A license plate cover was referred to as a "toy cover."
Window tint was discussed as being "35%."
I approached the male passenger.
The male passenger was [INSERT: suspect name].
I instructed the passenger to "pop out" of the vehicle.
I advised the passenger that I would explain the situation once he exited.
The subject complied with the command to exit.
I asked the subject if he had "nothing crazy" on him.
The subject replied, "Nothing."
A firearm was discovered on the subject's person during the interaction.
It was announced, "I got a fire on you."
Commands were issued to the subject to "Don't reach."
Commands were issued to the subject to "Don't touch it."
The subject was asked if the weapon was loaded.
The response regarding the weapon being loaded was "No."
I instructed that the subject be placed in handcuffs immediately.
The weapon was being secured.
A concern was voiced regarding the chain mechanism to ensure the firearm did not discharge.
The subject was secured.
I remarked that the subject had been "shaking like a leaf" as soon as I walked up to him.
The subject denied shaking due to nervousness.
The subject stated repeatedly that he just had "to take a piss."
I requested a transport unit to the location of West Main and Morton.
I requested "firearm coverage."
The subject stated, "I'm not pulling away."
The subject was advised to "chill out."
