I reported my location as West Newark and New Orleans.
I advised dispatch that one individual was in custody.
I ordered the suspect, "Don't fucking move."
I advised that a firearm had been recovered.
I observed other individuals in the vicinity.
I repeatedly commanded other individuals to "back up."
I communicated with unit 421.
I stated to unit 421, "I'm with him."
I stated to unit 421, "I got it."
I questioned the suspect repeatedly regarding the recovered weapon.
I asked the suspect, "You got a license to carry?"
I commanded the suspect to look at me.
The suspect responded, "Yes."
I asked the suspect if he had an LTC.
The suspect asked if he could get his phone.
I denied the suspect's request to get his phone.
The suspect made statements regarding "crafting."
The suspect exclaimed, "No, no, my God."
I ordered the suspect to "sit up."
The suspect inquired why I had removed his hat.
I explained I removed the hat so I could see his eyes.
I advised the suspect that I was going to read him a Miranda right before asking any questions.
I asked the suspect, "Do you understand that?"
[INSERT: suspect's response to Miranda warning, if any]
The suspect asked to get up.
I told the suspect to hold on.
The suspect inquired about a "daughter."
The suspect asked for his hat back.
I informed the suspect we would bring his hat to him.
I informed the suspect we were moving him to another location.
I stated that I needed to take a look in the bag.
The suspect became agitated.
The suspect asked, "Why the fuck you fucking cuff my bag with me, bro?"
I replied, "We should've cuffed you."
I proceeded to get the suspect up.
