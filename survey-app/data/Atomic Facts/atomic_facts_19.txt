I was involved in an incident at a location identified as "Lullaby American Legion."
I made contact with a male subject.
I questioned the subject regarding his purpose in the area.
I asked the subject if he had his son.
I asked the subject where he was picking his son up.
I observed to the subject, "You don't live in the street where you're picking up your son."
I remarked to the subject that "this is a problem."
I remarked to the subject that the situation was "weird."
The subject stated, "I don't know how to get here."
The subject stated, "I don't know the name of this place."
I asked the subject if he grew up in Boston.
The subject responded, "I grew up here."
I asked the subject if he had any weapons "in the barrel."
The subject replied, "Nothing."
I instructed the subject, "You should get the vehicle for me."
I informed the subject that he would have to "step out real quick."
I informed the subject that I needed to "make sure there are no weapons."
I asked if there was "nothing in the car."
I asked if there was "anything in the car."
The subject confirmed, "Nothing in the car."
I conversed with [INSERT: other officer identified in audio].
The conversation regarded the status of the detention.
I stated, "Nobody was in cuffs or anything yet."
I noted that I "didn't want to say it out loud."
I confirmed via radio that "we have a traffic stop."
I stated the stop involved a man at the American Legion location.
I advised dispatch, "You can call it, I think, 8-0."
