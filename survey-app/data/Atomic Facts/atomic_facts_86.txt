I responded to a call regarding a male party.
The male party stated a child's mother was driving erratically.
The male party stated the mother was driving a silver Chevy.
The male party mentioned "unknown play with children and people."
The reporting party claimed he was no longer in the area.
I made contact with the occupants of a silver Chevy.
I asked the occupants if they had any identification.
I asked the occupants if they had any licenses.
The occupants indicated they had "none whatsoever."
I observed that nobody in the vehicle was wearing a seatbelt.
The occupants confirmed that the vehicle was a rental car.
The occupants confirmed that the vehicle was not owned by them.
I proceeded to gather identifying information from the individuals.
One male subject identified himself as "Abel."
One male subject acknowledged the name "Jefferson."
One male subject initially struggled to provide a complete date of birth.
One male subject eventually mentioned the year 2000.
Another male occupant presented a picture of his ID.
I obtained the second male occupant's information.
A third individual stated he did not know his full social security number.
The third individual provided the last four digits of his social security number.
The group advised they were from Lynn.
I instructed the occupants to "step off the seatbelt."
I instructed the occupants to exit the vehicle.
I asked the occupants if they had any weapons on them.
The subjects complied with the instruction to exit.
The subjects stood by as directed.
[INSERT: Name of Speaker 01] asked if I had "padded" the subjects down.
A pat-down search of the subjects was conducted.
