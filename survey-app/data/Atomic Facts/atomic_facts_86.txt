I was on patrol at about 12:35 a.m. on Saturday, March 9, 2024.
I was with members of the Youth Violence Strike Force.
The Youth Violence Strike Force is also known as the Gang Unit.
We were in the area of Massachusetts Avenue Connector.

We immediately activated our cruisers' emergency lights.
We immediately activated our cruisers' sirens.

The operator was unable to produce a physical copy of his license.
We observed the car to be occupied by four other passengers.
We noticed the passengers were not wearing their seatbelts.
We requested identification from all occupants.
One occupant refused to roll down his window.
We requested the occupants to exit the vehicle.
All occupants exited the vehicle except for Abel Severino Reyes.
Abel Severino Reyes continued to disregard our orders.
We made multiple attempts to have Reyes exit the vehicle.
We were able to have Reyes exit the vehicle.
We conducted a pat frisk of Reyes.
We recovered a large plastic bag from inside the suspect's jacket pocket.
We recovered the item immediately during the search.
The bag contained a soft, powdery substance.
The seized drugs were later determined to be fentanyl.
The drugs weighed 101 grams.
Severino Reyes was placed under arrest.
Severino Reyes was charged with trafficking of Class A.
We attempted to identify the remaining passengers during the investigation on scene.
