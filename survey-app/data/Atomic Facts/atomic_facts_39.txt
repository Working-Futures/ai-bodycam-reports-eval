I was present at the Maverick projects on [INSERT: Date/Time].
I observed a group of individuals.
I asked the group, "Why y'all moving like that?"
I asked the group, "What's up?"
I walked up on the male suspect.
The male suspect started walking away.
The suspect walking away caused me to question his behavior.
I initiated a foot pursuit.
I broadcasted "101 foot chase."
The pursuit led to a location on London Street.
I located the suspect in a backyard.
I issued verbal commands to the suspect.
I told the suspect, "Don't fucking move."
I made physical contact with the suspect.
I stated, "I feel him."
I repeatedly instructed assisting officers to "Cuff him."
The suspect was placed in handcuffs.
The suspect was detained behind the building.
I advised other units that we had the suspect in custody.
I located a firearm in the immediate vicinity during the encounter.
I announced, "I got the firearm right here."
I identified the weapon as a Glock.
Another officer on scene confirmed that the weapon looked like a Glock.
I asked the suspect, "You got a gun?"
I instructed officers to "Search him again" following the detention.
I repeatedly demanded to see the suspect's license to carry.
I asked the suspect, "Where's your license to carry?"
I asked the suspect, "You don't have one?"
I instructed the assisting officers to retrieve a Miranda card from the patrol vehicle.
I instructed the assisting officers to read the suspect his Miranda rights.
